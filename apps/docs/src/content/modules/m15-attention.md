title: Attention
summary: Build attention from a soft dictionary lookup. Scaled dot-product. Q, K, V as projections of the same X. Causal masking. Permutation-equivariance and three flavors of positional encoding. Multi-head as parallel subspaces. The T² cost and the KV-cache that tames it.

endgameConnection: 'Attention is one operation: every position broadcasts a query, every position offers a key, the softmax-weighted match decides whose values you pull back. Residuals, layer norm, and the MLP that follows are plumbing around that core idea, and you are now one layer of glue away from a real transformer.'
