title: Tokenization, Training & Sampling
summary: How text becomes integer ids (BPE). How the M16 forward pass becomes a working model (the training loop with AdamW, warmup, cosine decay, gradient clipping). How a trained model becomes text again (autoregressive sampling with temperature, top-k, top-p, and the KV cache that makes inference O(T)).

endgameConnection: 'A tokenizer makes text countable. A loop makes a model learnable. A sampler makes a model talk. Next module: do it for real.'
