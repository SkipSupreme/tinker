# Design System — Tinker

*Locked by `/design-consultation` on 2026-04-24. Positioning pivot on 2026-04-24 after logo approval.*

> Every visual, UI, typography, color, spacing, motion, sound, and haptic decision in this repo MUST check against this file. If code deviates from this file, it's a bug.

## Product Context

- **What this is:** Tinker is a **general-purpose interactive learning platform.** Any subject, any age, same playful tone. Live at learntinker.com.
- **Who it's for:** Everyone who wants to *tinker* with ideas. The founder learns first (Math-for-ML is the v1 course), then Oliver (the founder's son) gets tracks built for him, then everyone else. Kids and adults, same product, same voice.
- **Starting content:** Math-for-ML (Derivatives → Gradients → Linear Algebra → Optimization → Neural Nets → Backprop → Attention → Train a GPT). Next tracks will be authored based on what the founder wants to learn and what Oliver is ready for. Platform is content-agnostic.
- **Space:** Ed-tech. Adjacent to Duolingo (play-first), Brilliant (interactive, intermediate), Khan Academy (K–12 through intro college), Math Academy (rigor), 3Blue1Brown (visual intuition), Mathigon (playground), Beast Academy (kids-first rigor). We take the play-first energy, the widget rigor, and the respect-the-learner voice, whether the learner is 9 or 39.
- **Project type:** Web app built with Astro 6 + Svelte 5 + MDX + a custom svelte-mafs interactive-math widget engine. Deploys to Cloudflare Workers. Capacitor wrap for iOS planned.
- **Core belief:** adults can play. Kids can learn hard things. "Big boys and big girls" is the register. No corner of the product talks down to the learner.

## Positioning

**"Tinker — Play. Learn. Grow."**

Playful and inviting on the outside. Rigorous on the inside. A 9-year-old learning fractions and a 34-year-old learning backpropagation should both feel welcome and both feel like the product respects them. The tone is warm and a little silly. The content doesn't cheat the math.

## Mascot — Tinker the Apple

A flat cartoon apple with a cream face and a gentle smile. Apple-red body, two leaves on top (one teal, one pink), three sparkle marks above (orange, teal, red). Deliberately *not* an owl — Duolingo owns the owl-as-learning-mascot register; the apple is the older "teacher's apple" symbol with no current category-defining brand on it. Logo lockup pairs the apple with the "Tinker!" wordmark in Nunito 800 + the "PLAY. LEARN. GROW." subtitle in three-color caps.

### Where Tinker appears

- **Logo and wordmark** (all marketing surfaces, app icon, favicon, browser tab).
- **Landing hero** (greeting the visitor).
- **Loading states** (apple gently bobbing, optional book or sparkle).
- **Empty states** (apple pointing to what to do next, or sleeping with a "z").
- **Celebration moments:** after a lesson, the apple does a quick double-hop. After a module, a graduation cap drops onto its leaves. After a whole course, sparkles burst around it.
- **404 page** (apple with a magnifying glass, lost).
- **Social sharing cards.**

### Where Tinker does NOT appear

- **Inside lesson bodies.** The moment the learner is doing math, the content takes over. Tinker doesn't hover in the margins of a chain-rule derivation. Distracting.
- **Inside widgets.** Math objects are the visual language of the widgets themselves (draggable points, vectors, tangent lines). The apple doesn't stand on the coordinate plane.
- **Next to paywall / consent / legal copy.** Anywhere seriousness is required. Tinker is for the fun parts.

### Expressions planned

Default smile, wide-eyed surprise, sleeping (loading / idle), graduation cap (module complete), magnifying glass (404 or search), sparkle burst (easter egg / course complete). Expressions ride on the same base apple silhouette — accessories layer on top, the apple itself doesn't morph.

### Interactivity — Tinker is alive

Tinker is **never a static PNG**. The mascot has idle behavior, reacts to the user, and hides delight. This is a first-class product feature, not decoration. Implementation lives in `components/brand/Tinker.svelte` — interactive Svelte component driving idle, hover, and click states.

**Idle behavior (always on):**
- **Idle bob** — ±6px vertical drift, 4.6s sine loop. Almost subliminal.
- **Sparkle pulse** — the three sparkle marks above the apple shift opacity slightly on a slow loop. Reads as "alive but calm."

**Reactive behavior:**
- **Cursor tilt** — when the cursor is over the hero region, the apple rotates ±3° toward the cursor's horizontal position. Subtle, feels like the mascot is paying attention.
- **Hover** — slight scale-up (~2%) on the mascot, with a transition.
- **Click** (any tap on Tinker):
  1. Quick bounce (scale 1.0 → 1.06 → 1.0 in 240ms with spring easing).
  2. Math-symbol burst of 5 particles (π, ∫, ∂, ∞, Δ, ∑, …) in teal / pink / orange.
  3. `tick` audio.
  4. Increments an invisible "pet counter" stored in localStorage. Every 10th click triggers a 18-particle milestone burst.

**Proactive hints (planned, not yet built):**
- When a learner is stuck on a `StepCheck` for 30+ seconds without submitting, Tinker pokes in from a corner with a speech-bubble hint drawn from the step's `hint` prop.
- Dismissible by clicking anywhere or pressing Escape. Max one per step, max one per 2 minutes globally. No nagging.

**Celebration choreography:**
| Moment | Animation |
|---|---|
| Correct StepCheck | Math-symbol burst at the Check button + `ding` audio. |
| Lesson complete | Apple does a double-hop (~720ms), green sweep across the lesson-complete card, full math-symbol burst, `chime` audio. |
| Module complete | Graduation cap drops onto the apple's leaves (~1100ms), bigger math-symbol burst, `anthem` audio. |
| Course complete | Full-screen math-symbol burst, sparkle accents, sustained chime. |

**Easter eggs (some shipped, some planned):**
- **Pet counter** ✅ — every 10th click in a session triggers a milestone math-symbol burst (18 symbols, 1.4× spread).
- **Konami code** (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) — apple wears tiny sunglasses for 10 seconds and bobs to a silent beat. *Planned.*
- **Type "tinker"** anywhere (captured keyboard input when not focused on an input) — apple does a quick bounce and a teal sparkle. *Planned.*
- **Birthday hat** — if the user has a birthdate in profile, that day the apple wears a party hat site-wide. *Planned.*
- **Milestone badges** appear on the apple after course completions: tiny graduation-cap icon for each completed course. *Planned.*

All interactivity respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — bobbing and cursor-tilt are disabled. The click bounce still fires because it's a deliberate user response, not ambient motion. The math-symbol confetti is a no-op under reduced motion.

### Accessory ink

Accessory overlays (Konami sunglasses, graduation caps) draw in `--mascot-ink` (`#1a1a1a`), a theme-independent near-black defined once in `global.css`. It never flips with `[data-theme]` because the mascot's own palette is constant; only the canvas around it adapts.

### Rules

- Tinker is always rendered from the approved source asset (`/logo.png`). No re-drawing, no filter swaps, no AI regens that drift the character.
- Tinker keeps the original apple-red body, cream face, and teal/pink leaves on every surface. The canvas palette adjusts around the mascot, not the other way around.
- Tinker does NOT appear inside lesson bodies or widgets. See "Where Tinker does NOT appear" above.
- The mascot is **not** an owl. If a future asset drifts toward owl-shaped silhouettes, that is a bug — the apple is the brand.

## Aesthetic Direction

**Rigorous Delight — play-first skin, rigorous core.**

Marketing, onboarding, celebration, navigation, empty states: **playful**. Rounded geometry, warm typography, math-symbol confetti, sound, haptic bursts. Tinker the apple doing things. The confetti palette (teal, orange, pink) as accents on marketing surfaces.

Inside lessons, inside widgets, inside the knowledge graph: **rigorous**. Clean typography, Fraunces serif for display moments, Inter for prose, math-widget-as-illustration, no cartoon elements, no hand-drawn decoration. The content is the content.

The two registers share the same palette and type system, so the transition never feels jarring — it's the same product, dialed up or dialed down depending on what the user is doing.

**Decoration level:** intentional. Ambient math-object motifs on lesson surfaces. Confetti-dot motifs on marketing surfaces. Mascot takes the decorative weight on hero and celebration surfaces.

---

## Color

Tokens live in `apps/docs/src/styles/global.css`. Use the CSS variable, never the hex directly.

### Surface bands (alternating for rhythm)

| Var | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--band-onyx` | `#fff4ec` light / `#08090b` dark | Theme-aware hero + closing CTA surface. Light mode is warm cream (pairs with the red mascot); dark mode is near-black. global.css is the source of truth. |
| `--band-white` | `#fdfdfc` | Primary light surface. |
| `--band-cream` | `#faf6ef` | Warm-light section. |
| `--band-mint` | `#e6f3e8` | Success / approval section. |
| `--band-sky` | `#e6eff8` | Reflective / who-it's-for section. |
| `--band-butter` | `#fbf2dc` | Quote / pull-out section. |

Dark-theme variants for each band are defined in `:root[data-theme="dark"]` in the same file.

### Ink accents

| Var | Light hex | Dark hex | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--ink-red` | `#e6396a` | `#ff7095` | **Primary brand color.** Apple body, display italic accent words, primary math ink. Replaced `--ink-violet` in the 2026-04-24 owl→apple pivot. |
| `--ink-coral` | `#ff6a4d` | `#ff8a74` | Interactive elements (drag handles, tangent lines). |
| `--ink-sea` | `#2a9fd6` | `#5db4e0` | Secondary math (axes, grids), info state. |
| `--ink-sun` | `#f2b400` | `#f5c745` | XP, streak flame, warmth accents. |
| `--ink-teal` | `#4ecdc4` | `#6de0d7` | Confetti accent. Celebration moments. One of the apple's leaves. |
| `--ink-pink` | `#ff4f9e` | `#ff7bbd` | Confetti accent. The other apple leaf. Playful emphasis. |
| `--ink-orange` | `#ff9f43` | `#ffb873` | Confetti accent. Energy beats. |

### CTA (always green, always the one green)

| Var | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--cta` | `#22c55e` | Primary CTA pill. Completion fill. "Ding!" visual pulse. |
| `--cta-hover` | `#16a34a` | Hover on CTA. |
| `--cta-fg` | `#0a1a10` | Text on green CTA. |
| `--cta-edge` | `#15803d` | The darker "shelf" under pressable buttons (box-shadow `0 4px 0`). Resting buttons sit on it; `:active` collapses it while the button travels down 4px, so the press reads as physical depth. Both themes. |

**Pressable button recipe (primary CTA):** pill radius, `box-shadow: 0 4px 0 var(--cta-edge)`, hover lifts 1px and brightens to `--cta-hover`, active translates down 4px and zeroes the shelf. Secondary buttons use the same mechanics with `--demo-card` fill and `--site-border` shelf. Focus ring comes from the global `:focus-visible` (sea blue).

### Text

| Var | Light | Dark | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--site-fg` | `#17181a` | `#ededec` | Body text. |
| `--site-fg-muted` | `#585a60` | `#9a9a98` | Lede, metadata, hints. |

### Rules

- **Red (`--ink-red`) is the primary brand color.** Mascot body, any single-accent-only moment, display italic accent words. **Purple/violet is explicitly retired** — it's the AI slop color.
- **Confetti palette (teal + orange + pink) is for celebration.** Never use more than two confetti colors together in a single element — three becomes carnival.
- **One CTA color per page.** Green is the only button color that promises action.
- **Sun stays in XP/streak territory.** Don't spread it.
- **Dark mode is a redesign, not an inversion.** Hand-tuned block already in `global.css`. Do not auto-invert.

## Typography

Four faces. Google Fonts loaded in `Base.astro`. If a new face is needed, add to that `<link>`, update this file, done.

| Role | Family | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Wordmark | **Nunito** (700, 800, 900 + italic) | The "Tinker!" wordmark. Next to (or under) the apple. Rounded, heavy, warm. |
| Display | **Fraunces** (500, 600, 700, 800, italic) | Section headlines, lesson titles, big display moments. `text-wrap: balance` always. |
| Body | **Inter** (400, 500, 600, 700) | Lede, prose, lesson body, UI. |
| Mono / data | `ui-monospace`, `"SF Mono"`, Menlo | Readouts, step counters, code samples. |
| Gamification | **Space Grotesk** (500, 600, 700) | XP counters, streak numbers, badge text. Rounded-sans register that softens Fraunces. |

**Scale** (clamp-based, fluid):

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Display huge | `clamp(3rem, 9vw, 6.5rem)` |
| Display | `clamp(2.1rem, 5.5vw, 4.25rem)` |
| Display manifesto | `clamp(1.75rem, 4.5vw, 3.5rem)` |
| H2 step title | `clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem)` |
| Lede | `clamp(1.05rem, 1.6vw, 1.3rem)` |
| Body | `1rem` (16px base) |
| Small / meta | `0.82rem` |
| Mono code | `0.9rem` |
| Label / eyebrow | `0.75rem` uppercase, `0.14em` letter-spacing |

**Rules:**
- Wordmark uses Nunito 800, tight letter-spacing, one exclamation point at end for marketing lockups. Lowercase-t-with-dot style matches the logo asset.
- All `.display` headlines use `text-wrap: balance`.
- Italic on display is ALWAYS paired with a color accent (usually `--ink-red`). Never italic in plain body color.
- Numbers that matter use tabular-nums: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

---

## Spacing

Base unit: `4px`. Comfortable density. Implemented as `--space-2xs` … `--space-3xl` custom properties in `global.css`; use the variables, not bespoke rem values.

| Token | px |
|---|---|
| `2xs` | 2 |
| `xs` | 4 |
| `sm` | 8 |
| `md` | 16 |
| `lg` | 24 |
| `xl` | 32 |
| `2xl` | 48 |
| `3xl` | 64 |
| Band padding | `clamp(3rem, 7vw, 5.5rem)` vertical, `1.25rem` horizontal |
| Hero band padding | `clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6.5rem)` vertical |
| Band padding <380px | `clamp(2rem, 6vw, 3rem) 1rem` |

---

## Layout

- **Approach:** hybrid. Grid-disciplined inside widgets and lessons. Creative-editorial asymmetry in marketing bands.
- **Max content width:**
  - `--max-prose: 68ch`
  - `--max-shell: 1120px`
  - `--max-hero: 1200px`
- **Border radius:**
  - `--radius-sm: 4px`
  - `--radius-md: 8px`
  - `--radius-lg: 12px`
  - Widget cards: `20px`
  - `--radius-pill: 999px`
- **Shadow recipe for elevated cards:**
  `0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 24px 48px -28px color-mix(in srgb, <accent> 50%, transparent)`
  where `<accent>` is the dominant ink of the component.

---

## Motion

- **Easing:**
  - Enter: `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)` (spring-ish)
  - Exit: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)` (ease-in, quick)
  - Move / slider: `ease-in-out`
- **Duration:** micro 120-180ms · short 220-320ms · medium 450-700ms · long 900-1500ms.
- **Mascot animation:** Tinker blinks once per 4-8 seconds on hover surfaces. On celebration, Tinker does a 500ms hop. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — Tinker goes static.
- **No parallax. No scroll-jack.**

### Celebration sequences

| Event | Visual | Audio | Haptic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step advance | Soft slide-in, green ✓ flash | `tick` | `10ms` |
| Correct answer | Widget jiggle, green halo pulse, 6-particle confetti in teal/orange/pink | `ding` | `20ms` |
| Lesson complete | Full-width green sweep, Tinker does a hop, XP ticker animates, streak pulses | `chime` | `50ms` |
| Module complete | Full-screen confetti burst (teal/orange/pink), Tinker puts on graduation cap, XP burst | `anthem` | `[50, 100, 50]` pattern |

All celebrations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Audio mute-by-default only if `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; otherwise on.

---

## Sound

Four event tokens, each backed by a curated CC0 mp3 in `apps/docs/public/`. Implementation in `apps/docs/src/lib/sound.ts` plays them via `HTMLAudioElement`.

| Token | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `tick` | `humordome-soft-ui-pop-light-minimal-click-451232.mp3` | Step advance, widget snap, continue click. |
| `ding` | `freesound_community-ui_correct_button2-103167.mp3` | Correct answer. |
| `chime` | `freesound_community-melancholy-ui-chime-47804.mp3` | Lesson complete. |
| `anthem` | `freesound_community-success-1-6297.mp3` | Module complete. |
| `jump` | `freesound_community-cartoon-jump-6462.mp3` | Tinker mascot click bounce. |

Sounds escalate from a soft pop on every step click to a full success cue at module complete. Finishing a lesson *sounds* like finishing. The mascot has its own cartoon-jump cue so clicking Tinker feels physical.

Four additional CC0 mp3s sit in `/public/` for future events (woosh, camera shutter, button-pressed, confirm-tap). Wire them up the same way: edit the `PALETTE` map in `lib/sound.ts`.

Rules:
- Default on. Settings toggle to mute, persisted to localStorage.
- Sound only on earned state changes. Never on page load or navigation.
- If audio fails to load or play: fail silent, never throw.
- Respect `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — if so, default to off.

History: 2026-04-23..27 used hand-crafted Web Audio sine tones (zero asset cost). They sounded thin and synthetic; replaced 2026-04-28.

---

## Haptics

Mobile only (Capacitor native or PWA via `navigator.vibrate()`).

| Event | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Correct answer | `10ms` |
| Lesson complete | `50ms` |
| Module complete | `[50, 100, 50]` |

No haptics on step advance, no haptics on hover.

---

## Progress Loops — XP, Streak, Mastery

Duolingo-grade completion loops, minus the streak-shaming.

### XP

- Step advance: 1 XP
- Correct StepCheck first try: 5 XP
- Correct StepCheck 2nd-3rd try: 2 XP
- Lesson complete: 20 XP
- Module complete: 100 XP

Display: always visible in nav as `XP 2,340`, Space Grotesk with small upward-arrow glyph. On gain, `+N XP` floater near the event, ticker in nav, `tick` sound.

No XP cap. No leaderboards in v1.

### Streak

- Counted as consecutive UTC days with at least one completed step.
- Display: `14 🔥` (mascot-flame illustration is fine for marketing surfaces, emoji is fine for app chrome).
- Sundays never break a streak.
- Opt-in only. Off by default for the first 30 days of a user's lifetime; one-time prompt after that.
- Never send guilt push notifications. Ever.
- Max-streak saved separately as an all-time badge.

### Mastery (Skill-tree glow)

Module node transitions: `planned` (dashed, muted) → `reachable` (solid outline, subtle pulse) → `drafting` (butter fill, currently working) → `shipped`/`mastered` (green fill, solid label, optional glow).

Mastery defined as FSRS retention ≥ 0.75 once FSRS ships (Phase 3 of master plan). Until then, mastered = every lesson in module completed.

No-guilt rules: no red badges, no "falling behind" notifications, Sundays free.

---

## Decoration

Two decoration registers depending on surface:

**Marketing / hero / celebration surfaces:** Tinker the apple + floating math-symbol motifs (π, ∫, ∂, ∞, Δ, ∑ in teal/orange/pink) + big display typography. Rounded, warm, alive.

**Lesson / widget / knowledge-graph surfaces:** ambient math objects at 0.15-0.35 opacity. Vector arrows, coordinate points, grid fragments, integral symbols, derivative notation. No mascot inside widgets.

Rules:
- No icon circles. No stock-illustration ed-tech tropes (character with laptop, light-bulb in hand).
- Max 5 floating decorations per hero. More is noise.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → decorations freeze.

---

## Components (implementation targets)

Tokens and patterns must match this file. Deviations are bugs.

### Existing components to audit

- `Nav.astro` — replace SVG brand mark with `<img src="/logo.png">` and `Tinker!` wordmark in Nunito 800. Add XP counter + streak + avatar to right side.
- `pages/index.astro` — dark hero band (`--band-onyx`) with the apple mascot, Fraunces headline, floating math-symbol accents, green CTA, live math-widget card.
- `pages/courses/[course]/index.astro` — pastel arc bands, unchanged structurally. No mascot inside the course page.
- `components/course/SkillTreeMap.svelte` — node glow states for reachable / drafting / mastered; no mascot inside.
- `layouts/Lesson.astro` — celebration sequence on lesson complete (Tinker hops, sound, confetti, XP ticker). No mascot while the user is mid-lesson.
- `components/lesson/StepCheck.astro` — ding + confetti burst on correct answer.
- `components/demos/*.svelte` — widgets use `--demo-card` / `--demo-stage` / `--ink-*` tokens; no mascot inside.

### Components — current state

- `public/logo.png`, `public/logo-mark.png` — approved logo assets. ✅ shipped.
- `components/brand/Tinker.svelte` — interactive apple mascot. Idle bob, cursor-aware tilt, click-bounce, click math-symbol burst, pet counter, reduced-motion safe. ✅ shipped. Renamed from the original `.astro` plan because state-machine behavior requires reactivity.
- `components/celebrate/TinkerHop.svelte` — lesson- and module-complete hop animation, listens for `tinker:celebrate` window events with `{ level: 'lesson' | 'module' }`. Module level adds a graduation cap drop. ✅ shipped.
- `lib/sound.ts` — Web Audio sine palette (`tick` / `ding` / `chime` / `anthem`) with attack/decay envelopes, mute toggle persisted to localStorage, default-mute when reduced motion. ✅ shipped.
- `lib/xp.ts` — XP awards (`stepAdvance` / `correctFirstTry` / `correctRetry` / `lessonComplete` / `moduleComplete`), event emitters (`tinker:xp`, `tinker:streak`), `bumpStreak()`, `vibrate()` helper. ✅ shipped (streak-bumping wired but not called — see Decisions Log).
- `lib/confetti.ts` — `burst(target, opts)` particle helper using teal/pink/orange/violet, Web Animations API, self-cleaning layer, reduced-motion no-op. ✅ shipped.
- `components/nav/XpCounter.svelte` — XP readout with live `+N` floater and scale pulse. **Inlined into `Nav.astro`** rather than extracted as its own Svelte component. The Nav script listens for `tinker:xp` events directly. Promote to a standalone Svelte component if it grows beyond what fits in Nav.
- `components/nav/StreakFlame.svelte` — streak chip. **Inlined into `Nav.astro`** for the same reason. Display gated on `streak > 0`. Bump logic awaits the 30-day opt-in flow.
- `components/celebrate/ConfettiBurst.svelte` — replaced by `lib/confetti.ts` (a plain JS module). Functions, not components, are the right shape since callers fire from non-Svelte script contexts (the Lesson layout's TS script tag).

## Widget Visual Quality Bar

Every svelte-mafs widget in production must pass these invariants. A widget that fails the bar is a bug. Phase 1 captures current state into `audit-capture/` (broken or not) for the Phase 3 violation list; widgets are promoted to `baselines/` only when they pass.

### Invariants

1. **Plot margins.** Every widget reserves a minimum padding band around the plot rectangle. Axis labels, tick labels, legends, and title text live INSIDE that band, never abutting the plot edge or the widget container edge. Specific rule: `--mafs-plot-pad-x: 24px` minimum on left/right, `--mafs-plot-pad-y: 16px` minimum on top/bottom. Larger if labels need it; never smaller.

2. **No covered numbers.** Numeric labels never overlap data marks, gridlines, axis ticks, or other labels. When two labels would collide, ONE moves (alternate above/below, leader-line out, or hide the lower-priority label). When a label would cross a data mark, the label moves, not the mark. Pixel-diff visual regression catches obvious cases; bounding-box collision detection is queued in TODOS for cases that slip through.

3. **Alignment grid.** All in-widget elements snap to the same baseline grid as the surrounding lesson typography: `--baseline-grid: 4px`. Widget container padding, internal section gaps, and label positioning are multiples of the grid.

4. **Spacing tokens.** No bespoke `padding: 13px` or `margin: 7px`. Widget container, internal sections, label clusters, and control panels use named tokens: `--mafs-pad-tight (8px)`, `--mafs-pad-normal (16px)`, `--mafs-pad-loose (24px)`, `--mafs-pad-section (32px)`. New tokens added to `global.css` first; never one-off literals.

5. **Motion timing.** Idle / hover / interaction / state-change motion durations match DESIGN.md's existing motion tokens (`--motion-fast: 120ms`, `--motion-normal: 240ms`, `--motion-slow: 480ms`). No bespoke `transition: 200ms`; pick a token. Easing always references DESIGN.md's curves.

6. **Responsive behavior.** Widget renders correctly at `desktop` (≥1024px), `tablet` (640–1023px), `mobile` (<640px) viewports defined in `/dev/widget-lab/`. Labels reflow or rescale rather than truncate. Touch targets ≥44px on mobile.

7. **Reduced motion.** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables ambient/idle motion (bobbing, pulsing) but preserves user-initiated interaction feedback (click bounces, drag updates). Reduced-motion variant doesn't break the visual identity — the widget still looks composed, just calmer.

8. **Color tokens.** Zero hex literals in component CSS. All colors via `var(--token-name)` from `global.css`. Token values themselves live ONLY in `global.css`; DESIGN.md describes intent in prose. Stylelint enforces the no-hex rule in components; `global.css` is the only file allowed to contain hex.

### Audit surface

`/dev/widget-lab/` (env-gated; production builds exclude the route) renders every production svelte-mafs widget at desktop / tablet / mobile breakpoints with toggleable overlays for plot bounds, baseline grid, and container padding. The lab IS the audit surface: any widget that visibly fails an overlay check fails the bar.

### Two snapshot directories

- `audit-capture/` — current-state screenshots, broken or not. Used as evidence for the Phase 3 violation list. Never the source of truth.
- `baselines/` — accepted, Quality-Bar-passing screenshots. The regression-protection layer. Phase 1 starts empty; widgets graduate from `audit-capture/` to `baselines/` as they pass the checklist.

### Apple event API (hero context only)

Tinker the Apple reacts to the homepage hero widget via scoped DOM events bubbled on the hero region's parent. Event types and payload shapes live in `apps/docs/src/lib/tinker-events.ts`. Five events: `tinker:focus` (apple eye-tracks toward region), `tinker:drag` (apple leans in drag direction), `tinker:threshold` (apple face shifts on meaningful state change), `tinker:success` (celebration choreography fires), `tinker:idle` (return to ambient bob/sparkle).

`Tinker.svelte` keeps a small event buffer that replays events fired before its listener attached — handles Astro island hydration ordering. Coordinates in `focus` and `drag` payloads are normalized to the hero region's bounding box.

This pattern is **homepage-hero-only** by DESIGN.md decree (mascot does not appear inside lesson bodies or widget bodies). The scoped-DOM-events choice keeps the contract structurally bounded to where reactivity belongs.

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-24 | Design system created via `/design-consultation` | First real design pass. Approved hero variant: `variant-A.png`. User feedback: "Definite A". |
| 2026-04-24 | Dark hero band added (`--band-onyx #0b0d12`) | White hero looked like every other ed-tech landing. Dark hero with violet/coral ink creates premium read. |
| 2026-04-24 | Space Grotesk added | Rounded-sans register for XP/streak. Softens Fraunces + Inter where fun needs to show. |
| 2026-04-24 | Sound palette locked | User explicitly asked for "nice sounds when you complete something". Web Audio, zero bundle cost. |
| 2026-04-24 | XP + streak + mastery-glow progress loop | Duolingo completion loops without streak-shaming. Sundays always free. |
| **2026-04-24 (pivot)** | **Positioning: general learning platform, play-first, all ages** | **User dropped a cartoon owl logo and clarified the vision: "I've always wanted this as a general learning app. Starting with subjects I want to learn. Eventually tracks for my son Oliver. Adults can play too! And learn too! We're big boys now!" Tinker is a platform, not a math-for-ML-specific product. Play-first voice across all ages. Math-for-ML is track #1, not the whole thing.** |
| 2026-04-24 (pivot) | Cartoon mascot added: Tinker the Owl | Violet body, cream face, winking, confetti bursting. Lives on marketing surfaces, not inside lessons. Replaces "math objects are the mascot" rule on outer surfaces; math objects retain that role inside widgets. |
| 2026-04-24 (pivot) | Palette extended: teal, pink, orange | Confetti colors from the logo become first-class ink tokens. Used on celebration surfaces. |
| 2026-04-24 (pivot) | Wordmark face: Nunito 800 | Matches logo typography. Rounded, heavy, warm. |
| 2026-04-24 (build) | Implementation pass: alive layer | Built `lib/sound.ts`, `lib/xp.ts`, `lib/confetti.ts`, `components/brand/Tinker.svelte`, `components/celebrate/TinkerHop.svelte`. Wired `Lesson.astro` to play tick on advance, ding+confetti+XP on correct answer, chime+big confetti+TinkerHop on lesson complete. Nav listens for `tinker:xp` events and shows a `+N` floater + scale pulse. Static hero owl in `index.astro` replaced with the interactive `<Tinker />` (idle bob, hover-tilt, click-bounce, click confetti, pet counter). |
| 2026-04-24 (build) | Mascot interactive components are `.svelte`, not `.astro` | The Components section originally listed `Tinker.astro` and `TinkerHop.astro`. Interactive state machines (idle bob, click bounce, event listeners) need reactive runtime, so both are Svelte components mounted with `client:visible` (hero) or `client:idle` (lesson celebration). The Mascot — Interactivity section already implied `.svelte`; this clarifies the Components section to match. |
| 2026-04-24 (build) | Streak counts but does not display yet | `bumpStreak()` is implemented in `lib/xp.ts` but is NOT yet called from `Lesson.astro`. DESIGN.md §Streak gates display on a 30-day-then-opt-in prompt that hasn't shipped. Will wire on first completed step of the day once that opt-in flow exists. |
| **2026-04-24 (pivot v2)** | **Mascot: owl → apple. Primary color: violet → red.** | User: "I've flattened it out because the owl looked too much like Duolingo. AI uses purple way too much, it's the AI slop color." New asset is a flat cartoon apple in `public/logo.png` (1024×1536 with apple + Tinker! wordmark + PLAY/LEARN/GROW subtitle). `--ink-red` (#e6396a) replaces `--ink-violet` everywhere. The mascot is **deliberately not an owl** — Duolingo owns that register; the apple is the older "teacher's apple" symbol. |
| 2026-04-24 (pivot v2) | Confetti: dots → math symbols | User: "make the confetti like math symbols and shit". `lib/confetti.ts` now bursts π / ∫ / ∂ / ∇ / ∞ / ∑ / √ / Δ / x / + / = / etc. in Fraunces italic, palette teal/pink/orange (no purple). Hero static decorations are also six floating math symbols above the apple. Reinforces the "math is play" identity. |
| 2026-04-24 (pivot v2) | Owl-specific Mascot interactions retired | Eye tracking, blink, head tilt, "settles to nap" assumed owl physiology (eyes, pupils, head/body separation). The flat apple has none of those. Replaced with idle bob, sparkle pulse, cursor-aware tilt of the whole apple, click bounce + math-symbol burst. Mascot Interactivity section in this file rewritten accordingly. |
| 2026-05-29 (audit) | `--band-onyx` is now theme-aware: light `#fff4ec` (warm cream), dark `#08090b` | Pre-launch readiness audit corrected token drift. The 2026-04-24 entry above recorded the original near-black `#0b0d12`; the live token was reworked so light mode pairs warm cream with the red mascot. global.css is the source of truth. |
| 2026-05-29 (audit) | Removed orphaned `--band-lavender` (`#ecebfb`) | It was a lavender/purple surface band that violated the no-purple rule, was never defined in global.css, and was referenced by no component. Dropped from the doc to stop it being a trap for future authors. Use `--band-sky` for a cool-light section. |
| 2026-06-11 (homepage polish) | Added `--cta-edge` + pressable-button recipe; spacing scale implemented as `--space-*` tokens; focus ring re-pointed at `--ink-sea` | Homepage design review. Buttons gain Duolingo-style physical press depth. The old focus colors (`#2f6fed` light, `#8aa7f6` dark) were off-palette template blue, and the dark one read lavender, violating the no-purple rule. `--site-accent` (body link blue) is still off-palette and remains an open item. |
| 2026-07-06 (design review) | `--site-accent` re-pointed at the sea ink: light mode is `color-mix(in srgb, var(--ink-sea) 70%, var(--site-fg))` (raw sea is only ~2.9:1 on light surfaces), dark mode is `var(--ink-sea)` directly. | Closes the open item above. Body links, blockquote borders, and the skip-link now sit on the palette; the lavender-reading `#8aa7f6` is gone. |
