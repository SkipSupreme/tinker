## 1. Concept dependency graph

A topologically sorted list. Concept ids are kebab-case; prerequisites refer to earlier-module ids (e.g. `m7-linear-algebra`) or this module's own ids.

1. **`weighted-sum`**. A neuron computes `w·x + b`, a single scalar dot-product plus an offset. *Prereqs:* `m7-linear-algebra` (dot product), `m4-pre-algebra` (sums).
2. **`bias-as-offset`**. The bias `b` is the scalar that shifts the decision boundary off the origin; without it every hyperplane passes through `0`. *Prereqs:* `weighted-sum`.

8. **`linear-composition-collapse`**. Stacking linear layers without nonlinearity is mathematically equivalent to a single linear layer: `W₂(W₁x + b₁) + b₂ = (W₂W₁)x + (W₂b₁ + b₂)`. *Prereqs:* `linear-layer`, `m7-linear-algebra` (matrix multiplication associativity).
9. **`activation-function`**. A scalar nonlinearity applied elementwise after a linear layer; you anything. *Prereqs:* `linear-composition-collapse`.

22. **`parameter-count`**. The number of learnable scalars in a layer is `(in_dim · out_dim) + out_dim`; total params is the sum across layers and dominates memory/compute. *Prereqs:* `linear-layer`.
23. **`mlp-as-ffn-block`**. In a transformer, the per-token feed-forward block is exactly `Linear → activation → Linear`: i.e. a 2-layer MLP, applied independently to every token. *Prereqs:* `mlp`, `forward-pass`.

## 2. Canonical worked examples

These six are the *defaults* across CS231n, MIT 6.S191, Karpathy ZTH, 3Blue1Brown, and Goodfellow et al. Pick these because students will encouher resource they consult.

### 2.1: A single perceptron computing AND

**Problem.** Find weights $w_1, w_2$ and bias $b$ such that the perceptron $y = \text{step}(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b)$ outputs 1 on $(1,1)$ and 0 on $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$.

**Solution.** Choose $w_1 = w_2 = 1$, $b = -1.5$. Verify: $(1,1) \to 0.5 \to 1$; $(1,0) \to -0.5 \to 0$; $(0,1) \to -0.5 \to 0$; $(0,0) \to -1.5 \to 0$. The decision boundary is the line $x_1 + x_2 = 1.5$.

**Pedagogical point.** A perceptron *is* a hyperplane plus a threshold; learning weights = placing a line. The bias is what lets the line miss the origin.

**Most common student mistake.** Trying $b = 0$ "because zero is the natural starting point", produces a boundary forced through the origin that cannot fit AND. This is the moment to make bias non-optional.

---

### 2.2: XOR is not linearly separable

**Problem.** Prove no single perceptron $y = \text{step}(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b)$ can compute XOR: $(0,0)\to 0, (0,1)\to 1, (1,0)\to 1, (1,1)\to 0$.

**Solu* Suppose such weights exist. From $(0,0)\to 0$: $b < 0$. From $(1,0)\to 1$: $w_1 + b > 0 \Rightarrow w_1 > -b > 0$. From $(0,1)\to 1$: similarly $w_2 > 0$. Then $w_1 + w_2 + b > -b + (-b) + b = -b > 0$, forcing $(1,1) \to 1$. Contradiction. ([Berkeley CS189 lecture notes](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s19/lec/17.pdf))

**Pedagogical point.** This is the historic moment ([Minsky & Papert 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book))) that motivates everything that follows. It's a 4-line proof a software engineer can do over coffee, and it forces the question: *what's the smallest extension that fixes this?*

**Most common student mistake.** Believing "XOR is just hard" rather than "XOR is the smallest example of a non-linearly-separable problem"; missing that the *exact same proof technique* shows any topologically equivalent dataset (concentric rings, two interlocking spirals) is also impossible for a single linear layer.

---

### 2.3: Solving XOR with a 2-2-1 MLP

**Problem.** Conruct an MLP with two hidden ReLU units and one linear output unit that computes XOR exactly on $\{0,1\}^2$.

**Solution.** Hidden layer:
$$h_1 = \text{ReLU}(x_1 + x_2 - 0.5), \quad h_2 = \text{ReLU}(x_1 + x_2 - 1.5)$$
Output: $y = h_1 - 2 h_2$. Check: $(0,0)\to 0-2\cdot 0=0$; $(0,1)\to 0.5 - 0 = 0.5$; $(1,0)\to 0.5 - 0 = 0.5$; $(1,1)\to 1.5 - 2(0.5) = 0.5$. Threshold at $0.25$. (Alternative: NAND+OR composition à la [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-neural-networks-solve-the-xor-problem-59763136bdd7/).)

**Pedagogical point.** The hidden layer warps the input plane so the two classes become linearly separable. You can *hand-design* the warp; the network's job is to discover it.

**Most common student mistake.** Drawing the hidden units' decision boundaries on the *input* plane and trying to read XOR off of them directly. The right picture is two views: the (x₁, x₂) plane and the (h₁, h₂) plane, only the second one is linearly separable.

---

### 2.4: Forward pass arit2-3-1 MLP

**Problem.** Given $W^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & -0.2 \\ 0.1 & 0.4 \\ -0.3 & 0.6 \end{pmatrix}$, $b^{(1)} = (0, 0.1, -0.2)^\top$, $W^{(2)} = (1.0, -1.0, 0.5)$, $b^{(2)} = 0$, sigmoid hidden activations, and input $x = (1, 1)^\top$, compute $\hat y$.

**Solution.**
$z^{(1)} = W^{(1)} x + b^{(1)} = (0.3, 0.6, 0.1)^\top$.
$h = \sigma(z^{(1)}) \approx (0.5744, 0.6457, 0.5250)^\top$.
$z^{(2)} = W^{(2)} h + b^{(2)} = 0.5744 - 0.6457 + 0.5\cdot 0.5250 = 0.1912$.
$\hat y = z^{(2)} \approx 0.191$ (linear output).

**Pedagogical point.** A forward pass is just two matvecs and one elementwise sigmoid. There is no magic; it's high-school arithmetic in a loop.

**Most common student mistake.** Forgetting the bias on either layer, or applying the activation to the *output* layer when the task is regression. (Karpathy lists "passed softmaxed outputs to a loss that expects raw logits" as one of his canonical NN debugging gotchas; same family of bug.)

---

### 2.5: Why ReLU stacks beat sigmoid stacks (vaniing gradient demo)

**Problem.** Consider an 8-layer MLP with sigmoid activations everywhere. Initial weights are Gaussian, $w \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$. Why does training stall?

**Solution sketch.** $\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1-\sigma(z)) \le 0.25$. The chain rule sends gradients backward as a product of $\sigma'$ terms times weight matrices. After 8 layers the signal is attenuated by at least $0.25^8 \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-5}$ before *any* weight effect. With ReLU, the derivative is exactly 1 on the active half-line, so the gradient is preserved through every active path.

**Pedagogical point.** The reason ReLU became default is *not* aesthetic; it's that $\max(0, x)$ has gradient $1$ on its active region while $\sigma$ saturates. (See [the canonical ReLU-vs-sigmoid discussion](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/dl-question-bank/reports/ReLU-vs-Sigmoid-Function-in-Deep-Neural-Networks--VmlldzoyMDk0MzI).)

**Most common student mistake.** Concluding "ReLU is always better." Sigmoid is still right for a binary-probability output; tanh is still right inside LSTM gates and many small models (it's what micrograd uses); GELU is the right default in transformers.

---

### 2.6: MNIST-style 784-128-10 net parameter count

**Problem.** A network with input dim 784 (28×28 pixel image), one hidden layer of 128 units with ReLU, and 10-dim output. How many learnable parameters?

**Solution.** Layer 1: $784 \cdot 128 + 128 = 100{,}480$. Layer 2: $128 \cdot 10 + 10 = 1{,}290$. Total: $101{,}770$. Almost all parameters live in the first layer because input dimensionality dominates.

**Pedagogical point.** Parameter count is dominated by the widest matmul. Matters in M16 when we discuss why transformer FFN blocks use a 4× expansion factor, that's where a transformer's parameters mostly live.

**Most common student mistake.** Forgetting biases (off by $\approx 1\%$ here, but on a 1-billion-param model that's millions of parameters), or computing $784 \cdot 128 \cdot 10$ as if the network were one giant tensor product.

---

#. Universal approximation by sigmoid bumps (Nielsen-style intuition)

**Problem.** Sketch how a single-hidden-layer sigmoid network approximates an arbitrary continuous $f: [0,1] \to \mathbb R$.

**Solution sketch.** Use two hidden sigmoids per "bump": one with large positive weight at threshold $s$, one with large negative weight at threshold $s + \varepsilon$. Their difference, scaled, approximates a narrow rectangular pulse of arbitrary height at position $s$. Sum many such bumps in the output layer to approximate any Riemann-integrable function. ([Visual proof, Nielsen Ch. 4](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html), note: CC BY-NC, reference only.)

**Pedagogical point.** The theorem is *not* magic. It's "Riemann sums, but with sigmoids instead of indicators." It says **existence**, says nothing about how many neurons you need or whether SGD will find them.

**Most common student mistake.** Concluding "so deep networks are unnecessary, one wide layer suffices." The universal approxima theorem is silent on the *width* required, and in practice required width is exponential in input dimension for most useful functions, while depth lets you reuse subcomputations. (See [Mitliagkas IFT-6085 Lecture 10](http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6169-2022/ift-6169-lecture-10-notes.pdf).)

## 3. Common misconceptions

1. **"A neuron is a tiny model of a brain neuron."** *Why it's natural:* the name. The McCulloch-Pitts paper genuinely pitched it that way in 1943. *Kill with:* the side-by-side that an artificial neuron is one dot product plus one scalar function, while a real cortical neuron involves dendritic compartments, neurotransmitter dynamics, and ~10⁴ synapses, see [MIT News on grid-cell results](https://news.mit.edu/2022/neural-networks-brain-function-1102) and [the Sophos comparison](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/blog/man-vs-machine-comparing-artificial-and-biological-neural-networks). Reframe: "a neuron is just a weighted sum and a squash."

2. **"Deep just means lots of layers, metter."** *Why natural:* the marketing. *Kill with:* the linear-composition-collapse derivation `W₂(W₁x) = (W₂W₁)x` followed by a widget where the learner stacks five linear-only layers and confirms the decision boundary stays straight no matter how many layers they add.

3. **"The activation function is a hyperparameter you tune like learning rate."** *Why natural:* every tutorial lists ReLU/sigmoid/tanh/GELU as a dropdown. *Kill with:* a "what would break if I removed the nonlinearity?" diff-gym widget that lets the learner replace ReLU with identity and watch the network collapse to a line. Then introduce variants as fixes for *specific* failure modes, not as a zoo.

4. **"Bias is just a small correction. I can ignore it."** *Why natural:* it's the one parameter not visually depicted in many diagrams. *Kill with:* the widget where toggling bias = 0 forces the decision boundary through the origin, so the network can't even fit AND.

5. **"Universal approximation means MLPs can solve anything."*ural:* the name "universal." *Kill with:* explicit framing: existence theorem, not a constructive one; says nothing about (a) how many neurons, (b) whether gradient descent finds them, (c) generalization to new data. ([Wikipedia is precise on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem); "These are existence theorems… they do not provide a method for finding the network's parameters.")

6. **"Sigmoid is the 'default' activation because it looks biological."** *Why natural:* every textbook still leads with it. *Kill with:* the 8-layer-vanishing-gradient demo (Example 2.5). Sigmoid hasn't been the default hidden activation since ~2012.

7. **"More parameters = more accuracy."** *Why natural:* big-model triumphalism. *Kill with:* a fixed XOR dataset with sliders for hidden width 2 → 200, accuracy plateaus at 4 hidden units, then training instability rises. (Conceptually, this is a soft preview of overfitting which lands properly in M13.)

8. **"The MLP draws a curve around the da *Why natural:* the colored decision-boundary visualizations look like curves. *Kill with:* the layered transformation widget, show that what's actually happening is the input space is being *bent* so that a *straight* line in the final hidden representation classifies everything. The curve in input space is the pullback of a straight line. (This is exactly [Olah's manifolds-and-topology framing](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/).)

9. **"Hidden-layer outputs are meaningless soup."** *Why natural:* you can't read them. *Kill with:* a ConvNetJS-style widget that lets the learner select two hidden units and plot every input point in the (h₁, h₂) plane, they will see XOR-data become *linearly separable* in this learned coordinate system.

10. **"ReLU is broken because it's not differentiable at zero."** *Why natural:* calculus pedantry. *Kill with:* show that `0` is a measure-zero set; in practice frameworks define $\partial \text{ReLU}/\partial x|_{x=0} := 0$; in 8 years ction deep learning this has caused exactly zero real bugs.

11. **"GELU is just a smoother ReLU; the choice doesn't matter."** *Why natural:* visually they look similar. *Kill with:* the BERT/GPT-2 reference, at transformer scale, GELU consistently outperforms ReLU because gradient flow through the negative tail (near zero but nonzero) prevents dead-neuron pathologies in very deep stacks. Cite [Hendrycks & Gimpel 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12073).

12. **"The forward pass is the same thing as inference; backprop is something extra."** *Why natural:* they're presented sequentially. *Kill with:* an explicit foreshadow, "Module 12 builds backprop on the *exact same computation graph* you just built. The forward pass is the structure; backprop just walks it backwards." Pin this to the endgame callback.

## 4. Interactive widget suggestions

Every widget below grabs a *named mathematical object* (a weight vector, a bias, a ReLU kink, an input point, a hidden activation) and manipulates it direc Sliders are forbidden unless the slider value is itself the object the lesson named.

### 4.1: `perceptronLine`

**User manipulates directly.** Drags the *decision-boundary line itself* across a 2D scatter plot. Two grab handles: one rotates (sets $w$ direction), one translates perpendicular (sets $b$). Optional: drag the weight vector arrow at the origin and watch the orthogonal line update.

**Live updates.** Counts of correctly classified points update in real time; misclassified points flash red. The scalar values of $w_1, w_2, b$ display, derived from the line position. The half-plane is shaded.

**Concept.** Direct kinesthetic mapping between "geometric line in the plane" and "$w \cdot x + b = 0$." Shows that "training" = "moving this line."

**Beats slider+figure?** Yes, sliders for $w_1, w_2, b$ require the learner to mentally invert the parameterization. Dragging the *line* is the conceptual primitive; weights are the dependent readouts.

**Prior art.** [TensorFlow Playground](https://playgr.tensorflow.org/) (Apache 2.0) shows decision boundaries but does not let the user grab the line. [ConvNetJS classify2d demo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html) (MIT) renders the boundary but again read-only. We exceed prior art by making the line draggable.

---

### 4.2: `xorPlayground`

**User manipulates directly.** Drags the four XOR points $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$ around the plane (with snap-back button) and tries to draw a *single* separating line by dragging the line as in §4.1. Then unlocks a "second neuron", the user gets a second draggable line, and the widget renders the two-neuron hidden-space view side-by-side.

**Live updates.** Left panel: input space with the user's draggable line(s) and the four colored points. Right panel: $(h_1, h_2)$ space showing where each input lands after passing through the two ReLU neurons; updates as the user drags either line. A status indicator shows "linearly separable in hidden space?" yes/no.

**Concept.** The ataset is fixed in input space and **is not** linearly separable, but the two hidden ReLUs can warp it into a space where it **is**. The learner sees both pictures simultaneously.

**Beats slider+figure?** This widget is the entire pedagogical payload of the module. There is no slider equivalent.

**Prior art.** [Olah's manifolds-and-topology post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/) shows static layer-by-layer warps; ConvNetJS classify2d ([demo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html)) shows hidden-layer transforms in a fixed grid. The novel piece here is *both* spaces live, with both the boundary and the input points draggable.

---

### 4.3: `reluKinkDrag`

**User manipulates directly.** A 1D plot of a single ReLU neuron $f(x) = \max(0, wx + b)$. The learner drags the **kink point** along the x-axis. Internally this changes $b/w$ but the learner is grabbing the geometric kink, not a slider for `b`.

**Live updates.** The piecewise-linear functi plot redraws live. The slope handle (a separate rotational handle on the active arm) sets $w$. A live readout shows $w$, $b$, and the kink location $-b/w$. A second tab adds two ReLUs and shows their sum, illustrating how a *bump* is built from two ReLUs (the universal-approximation construction).

**Concept.** A ReLU isn't an "activation function" abstractly, it's a geometric hinge with a draggable corner. The location of the corner is determined by the bias.

**Beats slider+figure?** Yes, sliders separate the action ("change $b$") from the visual consequence ("the kink moves"). Dragging the kink fuses them.

**Prior art.** I am not aware of a widget that does exactly this; Distill articles on activations are all read-only static plots. This widget would be original to Tinker.

---

### 4.4: `forwardPassScrubber`

**User manipulates directly.** Places an input point $x$ in the input plane (drag), then *scrubs a timeline* labeled "input → linear 1 → activation 1 → linear 2 → activation each scrub position the visualization shows the current state of the activations as a colored vector / heatmap.

**Live updates.** As the timeline scrubs, the visualization morphs continuously between successive layers' activations (interpolating linearly between layer outputs for animation purposes, make this clear, since real networks don't have intermediate states). Dimensionality changes are shown by adding/removing colored squares.

**Concept.** A forward pass is a *sequence of transformations*. The input is gradually warped, layer by layer, into the output. Demystifies "what does the network do internally."

**Beats slider+figure?** Yes, a static figure of layers stacked vertically with arrows is in every textbook. The pedagogical move is *animation under direct control*.

**Prior art.** [Distill "The Building Blocks of Interpretability"](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/) (CC BY 4.0, adaptable!) shows layer-by-layer activations on a frozen image. We extend by letting the learner picknput *and* scrub the depth axis.

---

### 4.5: `decisionBoundarySculptor`

**User manipulates directly.** Click anywhere on a 2D canvas to add a labeled training point (left-click = class A, right-click = class B). A small MLP (configurable, default 2-4-4-1 with ReLU) trains in the browser via gradient descent on each click and the decision boundary updates.

**Live updates.** The colored decision-region rendering updates as training proceeds. Crucially, the user can also drag the *individual hidden-unit boundaries* (the kinks of each ReLU as draggable lines in the input plane) and watch the resulting decision region update, this connects "individual neurons each draw a line" to "the network's combined boundary is a polygonal mosaic of half-planes."

**Concept.** An MLP's decision boundary is *built from* the hidden neurons' individual hyperplane decision boundaries. The shape of the polygon you see is the union/intersection structure of the hidden ReLUs.

**Beats slider+figure?** Yes. TensorFlow ound has the dataset+architecture sliders but the *individual neurons' boundaries are not interactive*. Making each hidden unit's hyperplane a separately draggable object is the pedagogical leap.

**Prior art.** [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) (Apache 2.0; design ideas adaptable with attribution); [ConvNetJS classify2d](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html) (MIT). We can adapt design directly while crediting both. Consider also reading [Smilkov & Carter's Playground source on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground/blob/master/LICENSE).

---

### 4.6: `activationDiff`

**User manipulates directly.** A 2D classification dataset (selectable: XOR, two moons, concentric rings) with a 2-8-1 MLP. The learner picks an activation function from a *visual* palette: dragging a function-graph icon (sigmoid curve, tanh curve, ReLU hinge, GELU smooth-curve, *identity*) onto the hidden layer. Each icon is itself a small functional plot.

**Live updas.** Decision boundary, training loss curve, and a histogram of hidden-unit activations update on each new activation function chosen. Critical case: when the user drops "identity" on the hidden layer, the boundary collapses to a straight line *while training continues*, the linear-composition-collapse made experimentally visible.

**Concept.** "What would break if I removed the nonlinearity?", the question that motivates activations. Plus: comparison of sigmoid (saturates), ReLU (kinked, fast), GELU (smooth ReLU). Same dataset, same architecture, same training time → different qualitative behavior.

**Beats slider+figure?** Yes, the "drag the function onto the layer" interaction physicalizes the abstract slot of "activation function" as a *thing you can swap*. A multiple-choice dropdown does not.

**Prior art.** None precise. TensorFlow Playground has an activation dropdown; we differ by making the function graphs themselves the draggable objects, and by featuring identity as a "what breaks?" deion.

---

### 4.7: `paramCounter`

**User manipulates directly.** A network architecture is shown as draggable column-of-circles diagrams. The user drags layer widths up/down (each layer is a column the user resizes vertically by dragging its top edge) and adds/removes layers by drag-drop.

**Live updates.** Total parameter count updates per layer and overall. Memory cost in MB at fp32 displays. A bar chart shows what fraction of parameters lives in each layer. When the user makes the architecture absurdly wide, a warning indicates "this exceeds the GPT-2 small parameter count."

**Concept.** Parameter count scales like the product of adjacent layer widths plus output bias. It's the budget that bounds models.

**Beats slider+figure?** Yes, a width slider with a number printout could do this trivially, but resizing the layer *as a visual object* (the circles fan out, the connecting edges multiply) ties the symbolic count to the visual object. This is borderline, included because parameter literacy atter in M16-18.

**Prior art.** [Netron](https://netron.app/) (MIT) visualizes architectures statically; this widget makes the visualization mutable.

## 6. Lesson decomposition

Five lessons. Each is 8–15 gated steps. StepCheck answers are scalar or short symbolic.

### Lesson 11.1: "What's a perceptron, really?"
**Summary.** A single neuron is a weighted sum, a bias, and a threshold, and it draws a line.
**StepChecks.**
- *Compute:* For $w = (1, 1)$, $b = -1.5$, $x = (1, 1)$: what's the pre-activation? **Answer: 0.5.**
- *Construct:* Find $b$ such that with $w = (1, 1)$ the decision boundary passes through $(0.5, 0.5)$. **Answer: $b = -1$.**
- *Interpret:* A perceptron with $w = (3, -2)$, $b = 1$ classifies $(0, 0)$ as which class? **Answer: class 1 (since $0 + 0 + 1 > 0$).**
**Widgets.** `perceptronLine`.
**Estimated minutes.** 15.

### Lesson 11.2: "The XOR moment"
**Summary.** A single perceptron can't do XOR, and this 1969 fact is the reason neural networks have hidden layers.
**StepChecks.**
- *Proof-scaffold:* Fill in thequality: from XOR's $(0,1)\to 1$, we conclude $w_2 + b > \_$. **Answer: 0.**
- *Construct:* Find a 2-2-1 ReLU MLP that solves XOR. (Free-form, validated against truth table; multiple correct answers.) **Sample answer: $W_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $b_1 = (-0.5, -1.5)$, $w_2 = (1, -2)$, $b_2 = 0$, threshold at 0.25.**
- *Interpret:* In hidden-layer coordinates, what shape do the four XOR points form? **Answer: collinear / on a line.**
**Widgets.** `xorPlayground`, `perceptronLine`.
**Estimated minutes.** 18.

### Lesson 11.3: "Why a stack of linear layers is just one linear layer"
**Summary.** Without a nonlinearity between them, depth gets you nothing. This is why activations exist.
**StepChecks.**
- *Compute:* Given $W_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$, $W_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, what is the equivalent single matrix $W = W_2 W_1$? **Answer: $(2,\ 3)$.**
- *Debugging:* The student stacks 5 linear layers, no activations, and sees a straight decisi boundary. Is this a bug or expected? **Answer: expected.**
- *Construction:* Smallest activation function that "fixes" Lesson 11.3's problem? **Answer: any non-polynomial nonlinearity (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, GELU).**
**Widgets.** `activationDiff` (with identity option), drop in identity, watch boundary go straight.
**Estimated minutes.** 12.

### Lesson 11.4: "ReLU, and the activation zoo"
**Summary.** ReLU is the default for hidden layers in 2026, but you should know sigmoid (binary outputs), tanh (zero-centered, used in micrograd), and GELU (transformers).
**StepChecks.**
- *Compute:* $\text{ReLU}(-3) = ?$, $\text{ReLU}(2.5) = ?$. **Answer: 0, 2.5.**
- *Compute:* $\sigma(0) = ?$, $\tanh(0) = ?$. **Answer: 0.5, 0.**
- *Interpretation:* Why isn't $\sigma$ the default hidden activation in modern deep nets? **Answer: vanishing gradient (its derivative maxes at 0.25, products attenuate fast).**
**Widgets.** `reluKinkDrag`, `activationDiff`.
**Estimated minutes.** 18.

### Lesson 11.5: "Forward pass, ennd"
**Summary.** Run a real MLP from input to output by hand. Then count its parameters. Then take the universal approximation theorem seriously, but no further than it earns.
**StepChecks.**
- *Compute:* For the 2-3-1 net in Example 2.4 with input $(1, 1)$, what is the output (to 3 decimals)? **Answer: 0.191.**
- *Compute:* Parameters in a 784-128-64-10 network with biases? **Answer: $784\cdot 128 + 128 + 128\cdot 64 + 64 + 64 \cdot 10 + 10 = 109{,}386$.**
- *Interpretation:* "Universal approximation says any continuous function can be represented to arbitrary precision. So an infinite-width 1-hidden-layer MLP can solve anything." Identify the *two* things this claim oversells. **Answer: (1) it's existence-only, doesn't tell us how to find weights; (2) "continuous on a compact set," and width may be exponential in input dim.**
**Widgets.** `forwardPassScrubber`, `paramCounter`, `decisionBoundarySculptor`.
**Estimated minutes.** 22.

## 7. Problem bank (20 problems)

### Novice tier

**P1.** *(coation, `weighted-sum`)* For $w = (2, -1)$, $b = 0.5$, $x = (3, 4)$, compute $w \cdot x + b$. **Answer: 2.5.**

**P2.** *(computation, `sigmoid`)* Compute $\sigma(0)$, $\sigma(2)$ to 3 decimals. **Answer: 0.500, 0.881.**

**P3.** *(computation, `relu`)* Compute $\text{ReLU}(\text{input})$ for input $= (-2, 0, 0.5, 7)$. **Answer: $(0, 0, 0.5, 7)$.**

**P4.** *(computation, `tanh`)* Compute $\tanh(0)$ and $\tanh'(0)$. **Answer: 0, 1.**

**P5.** *(interpretation, `decision-boundary`)* A perceptron has $w = (1, 1)$, $b = -2$. Which side of its decision boundary is $(0, 0)$ on? Where does the boundary cross the $x_1$-axis? **Answer: negative side; crosses at $x_1 = 2$.**

**P6.** *(computation, `linear-layer`)* Given $W = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $b = (0, 0, 1)^\top$, $x = (2, 3)^\top$: compute $Wx + b$. **Answer: $(2, -3, 6)^\top$.**

**P7.** *(computation, `parameter-count`)* How many learnable parameters in a layer that maps $\mathbb{R}^{50} \to \mathbb{R}^{20}$ (with bias)? **Answer: $50 \cdot 20 + 20 = 1020$.**

### Intermediate tier

**P8.** *(construction, `perceptron`)* Find weights and bias for a perceptron that computes the OR function. **Answer: any with $w_1, w_2 > 0$, $-\min(w_1, w_2) < b < 0$. E.g. $w = (1,1), b = -0.5$.**

**P9.** *(proof-scaffold, `xor-problem`)* Show that NO weights $(w_1, w_2, b)$ make a perceptron compute XOR by deriving a contradiction from the four XOR constraints. (Free response; validate against the four inequalities above.)

**P10.** *(construction, `mlp`)* Construct a 2-2-1 MLP with ReLU hidden activations that computes the AND-NOT function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1 \land \neg x_2$. **Answer (one solution):** Hidden $h = \text{ReLU}(W_1 x + b_1)$ with $W_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}$, $b_1 = (-0.5, 0)$; output $w_2 = (1, 0)$, $b_2 = 0$, threshold at 0.25. (Many valid answers; grader checks truth table.)

**P11.** *(computation, `forward-pass`)* For a 2-2-1 MLP with $W^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $b^{(1)} = (0, 0)$, ReLU hidden, $W^{(2)} = (1, 1)$, $b^{(2)} = -1$, identity output: compute $\hat y$ for $x = (0.5, 1.0)$. **Answer: $\hat y = 0.5 + 1.0 - 1 = 0.5$.**

**P12.** *(debugging, `linear-composition-collapse`)* A learner builds a 4-layer MLP with no activation functions and is confused why training plateaus immediately. Explain in one sentence what's happening and what to add to fix it. **Answer: stacked linear layers compose to a single linear layer, so the model is mathematically equivalent to logistic regression; insert a non-polynomial activation (e.g. ReLU) after each hidden layer.**

**P13.** *(interpretation, `dead-relu`)* A ReLU neuron has weights $w = (-2, -1)$ and bias $b = -3$. For inputs in $[0, 1]^2$, will this neuron ever fire (output > 0)? **Answer: no, for $x \in [0,1]^2$, $w \cdot x + b \le 0 + 0 - 3 = -3 < 0$. It is a dead neuron with respect to this input domain.**

**P14.** *(computation, `parameter-count`)* For a 784-256-256-10 MLP with biases, total parameter count? **Answer: 84\cdot 256 + 256 + 256\cdot 256 + 256 + 256\cdot 10 + 10 = 269{,}322$.**

**P15.** *(construction, `decision-boundary`)* Sketch the decision regions of an MLP with two ReLU hidden units having decision boundaries $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 0$, with output $w_2 = (1, 1)$, $b_2 = -0.5$, threshold at 0. (Free response; the answer is: the network outputs 1 only in the region $x_1 + x_2 > 0.5$ where both hidden units are active.)

### Advanced tier

**P16.** *(proof-scaffold, `linear-composition-collapse`)* Show that a 3-layer MLP $f(x) = W_3 \phi(W_2 \phi(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2) + b_3$ with $\phi(z) = z$ (identity activation) is equivalent to a single linear layer. State the equivalent $W$ and $b$. **Answer: $W = W_3 W_2 W_1$, $b = W_3 W_2 b_1 + W_3 b_2 + b_3$.**

**P17.** *(interpretation, `universal-approximation`)* The universal approximation theorem says a single-hidden-layer MLP can approximate any continuous function on a compact set. Name three things the theorem does *not* tell you. **Answer (any three of):** how many hidden units are needed; whether SGD will find them; whether the network will generalize beyond the compact set; the case of discontinuous targets; computational tractability.

**P18.** *(construction, `mlp-as-ffn-block`)* Write down, in matrix notation, a transformer feed-forward block that takes a 4-dim token vector to a 4-dim output via a 16-dim hidden layer with GELU. State the parameter count. **Answer: $\text{FFN}(x) = W_2\, \text{GELU}(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2$ with $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{16 \times 4}$, $b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{16}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 16}$, $b_2 \in \mathbb{R}^4$. Parameter count: $4\cdot 16 + 16 + 16\cdot 4 + 4 = 148$.**

**P19.** *(debugging, `dead-relu`)* In a 2-layer ReLU network trained on a centered Gaussian dataset, a learner notices that 60% of hidden neurons have zero output for *all* training inputs. State two distinct causes and one mitigation each. **Answer (sample):** (1) Learning rate too high causing a large negative weight update, mitigation: lower learning te. (2) Symmetric initialization combined with all-negative biases, mitigation: switch to He / Kaiming initialization or use Leaky ReLU / GELU. (See [Lu et al. on dying ReLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06733).)

**P20.** *(construction + interpretation, `feature-space-warping`)* The two-spirals dataset cannot be linearly separated in the input plane. Sketch what the *minimum* hidden-space dimension and approximate hidden-layer width must be such that an MLP can separate it, and explain in one paragraph why. **Sample answer:** an MLP with one hidden layer of $\sim 16$ ReLU units in 2D input typically suffices; the hidden layer learns a 16-dim representation in which the spirals become approximately linearly separable. Lower bound: the construction must "unwind" each spiral arm, so the number of hidden ReLUs effectively bounds the polygonal complexity of the decision region, and a 2-arm spiral wrapping ~2× requires ~8–16 distinct hyperplanes worth of hinge points to approximate.

## 8. Endgame c: refined

The starter, *"The transformer's feed-forward block is literally an MLP"*, is good. Three sharper alternatives:

**Option A (preferred).**
> *The transformer's feed-forward block is a 2-layer MLP with GELU. Same matmul, same bias, same nonlinearity. You're already done with half of it.*

Why this wins: it's specific (2 layers, GELU), it ties to the exact thing they just learned (linear, activation, linear), and it foreshadows the Module 16 reveal without spoiling.

**Option B.**
> *Every transformer is a stack of attention blocks and MLP blocks. You've now built the MLP block. Two modules from now, we'll add attention, and that's the whole architecture.*

Why this is good: most explicit roadmap; works as a "you are here" marker.

**Option C.**
> *Modern LLMs spend roughly two-thirds of their parameters inside MLP blocks. The architecture you wrote on paper today is where most of GPT actually lives.*

Why this is good: a striking fact, grounded in [3Blue1Brown's MLP-in-transformer chapps://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/mlp/) ("facts seem to be stored inside a specific part of these networks known as the multi-layer perceptrons"). Use this if the audience needs motivation more than roadmap.

**Recommendation: A as the standard footer, C reserved for Lesson 11.5 specifically.**

## 10. Pedagogical traps

### Trap 1: Skippthe single neuron and starting at "deep learning"
**Why it happens.** "Deep learning" is what's exciting and what students think they signed up for. Many courses spend 90 seconds on a perceptron and 90 minutes on convnets.
**Mitigation.** Lesson 11.1 spends 15 minutes on *exactly one neuron* with `perceptronLine` as the central artifact. The student should be able to compute the AND function by hand before they ever see a hidden layer. Lock progression: Lesson 11.2 (the XOR moment) is gated on completing 11.1's StepChecks.

### Trap 2: Teaching activations as a memorize-the-zoo exercise
**Why it happens.** Sigmoid/tanh/ReLU/Leaky ReLU/PReLU/ELU/SELU/Swish/GELU/Mish, a textbook lists ten and asks the student to remember which is which.
**Mitigation.** Frame the entire activation-functions lesson around one question: *"What would break if I removed the nonlinearity?"* Lesson 11.3 demonstrates linear-composition collapse first; activations are introduced as the *fix*. Then in Lesson 11.4, only **four** aations get name-and-shape: sigmoid (output for binary), tanh (the micrograd one), ReLU (the default), GELU (the transformer one). The rest are footnoted in the problem bank.

### Trap 3: Universal approximation as "MLPs can do anything"
**Why it happens.** The name. Pop-science writeups. The visual proof in Nielsen Ch. 4 *looks* constructive.
**Mitigation.** When the theorem is introduced (Lesson 11.5, ~minute 18), pair it immediately with three caveats baked into the StepCheck (P17 in the bank): existence-only, no width bound, no training guarantee. The widget on this page is `forwardPassScrubber` rather than a "watch the universal approximator approximate" widget, we deliberately don't dramatize the theorem visually. Cite [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem)'s phrasing: *"They guarantee that a network with the right structure exists, but they do not provide a method for finding the network's parameters."*

### Trap 4: "Draw a curve around the dots"
**Why it h.** Decision-boundary heatmaps from TensorFlow Playground look like the network is drawing a smooth curve in the input plane.
**Mitigation.** `xorPlayground` and `decisionBoundarySculptor` always show *two* views: input space and hidden representation. The pedagogical claim is reinforced verbally and visually: *the network does not draw curves; it bends the space and then draws a line.* Olah's manifolds-and-topology framing is the spine. Reinforced in P15 (sketch decision regions from hidden-unit boundaries) and P20 (spirals).

### Trap 5: Letting "biological neuron" linger
**Why it happens.** Every textbook opens with the McCulloch-Pitts illustration. Students leave with a fuzzy "it's like a brain" mental model that is wrong in detail and breeds magical thinking later.
**Mitigation.** Acknowledge the historical motivation for ~30 seconds in Lesson 11.1, then **explicitly retire the analogy** with the Sophos-style comparison: real neurons have 10⁴ synapses, complex dendritic dynamics, neurotransmitter istry; an artificial neuron is one dot product and one scalar function. After that point, in all five lessons, the language is exclusively "unit," "neuron-as-named-by-history," or "ReLU unit", never "brain neuron." This matters because in Module 12 (backprop), the brain analogy directly impedes understanding of the chain rule.

### Trap 6: Forward pass before backprop being treated as inert
**Why it happens.** Students see the forward pass as "the answer" and backprop as "magic that finds weights."
**Mitigation.** The endgame callback for the entire module foreshadows Module 12 explicitly: *"You just built the computation graph. Next module, we walk it backwards."* Lesson 11.5's `forwardPassScrubber` widget keeps a hidden affordance, at the end of training, the same scrubber is reused in Module 12 with arrows reversed for backprop. Forward pass is presented as *the structure that backprop will exploit*, not as a self-contained skill.
