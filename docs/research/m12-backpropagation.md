# Module 12: Backpropagation from Scratch: Research Brief

## 1. Concept dependency graph

1. **computational-graph**. A directed acyclic graph whose nodes are intermediate values (including inputs, parameters, and the final scalar loss) and whose edges represent elementary operations that produced the child from its parents. *Prereqs:* m5-calculus, m6-multivariable, m11-neural-networks.
2. **forward-pass-as-graph-eval**. Evaluating the graph from leaf inputs toward the root by topologically walking each node and computing `node.data = op(parents.data)`. *Prereqs:* computational-graph.
3. **local-derivative**. The partial derivative of a node's output value with respect to each of its immediate parents, expressible from the op alone (e.g., for `z = x*y`, ∂z/∂x = y). *Prereqs:* m5-calculus, computational-graph.
4. **chain-rule-on-a-graph**. The multivariable chain rule reinterpreted as: "the derivative of the loss w.r.t. any node equals the sum over outgoing edges of (local derivae) × (loss-gradient of the downstream node)." *Prereqs:* m6-multivariable, local-derivative.
5. **upstream-vs-local-gradient**. The convention that at each node, `grad = upstream_grad * local_grad`, where "upstream" is dL/d(this node) and "local" comes from the op. Fixes the direction of information flow. *Prereqs:* chain-rule-on-a-graph.
6. **gradient-accumulation**. When a node has more than one outgoing edge (used multiple times), its total gradient is the *sum* over those paths, implemented in code as `self.grad += ...`. *Prereqs:* chain-rule-on-a-graph.
7. **reverse-mode-autodiff**. An algorithm that computes `dL/d*` for every node in one backward sweep by factoring the "sum over paths" so each edge is touched exactly once, starting from `dL/dL = 1` and moving parents-ward. *Prereqs:* chain-rule-on-a-graph, gradient-accumulation.
8. **forward-mode-autodiff**. Dual algorithm that propagates dual numbers forward from one input, computing one column of the Jacobian per sweep. Used as a contraeqs:* local-derivative.
9. **why-reverse-mode-for-dl**. For functions R^n → R^1 (i.e., loss functions), reverse mode costs O(forward pass) once, while forward mode costs O(n × forward pass). Neural-net losses have one output and millions of inputs, so reverse mode wins by a factor of n. *Prereqs:* reverse-mode-autodiff, forward-mode-autodiff.
10. **value-class**. The micrograd data structure: a Python object wrapping `.data` (scalar), `.grad` (scalar, initialized 0), `._prev` (parent Values), `._op` (string tag), and a closure `._backward` that knows how to distribute `self.grad` to its parents. *Prereqs:* computational-graph, local-derivative.
11. **per-op-backward-closures**. For each overloaded op (`__add__`, `__mul__`, `__pow__`, `tanh`, `exp`, `relu`), defining a `_backward` that reads `out.grad` and `+=` the correct local-derivative-scaled contribution into each parent's `.grad`. *Prereqs:* value-class, upstream-vs-local-gradient, gradient-accumulation.
12. **topological-sort**. Orderin so every node appears *after* all its children (for the reverse sweep: all its dependents). Built by DFS with a visited set; without it, diamond-shaped graphs give wrong gradients because a node's `_backward` runs before its downstream `.grad` is fully accumulated. *Prereqs:* computational-graph.
13. **backward-pass-implementation**. The top-level `loss.backward()`: build topo, set `self.grad = 1.0`, iterate topo in reverse calling each node's `_backward`. *Prereqs:* topological-sort, per-op-backward-closures.
14. **parameter-update-and-zero-grad**. Using computed gradients to update parameters via SGD/Adam, then explicitly resetting `.grad = 0` before the next forward pass, because `+=` would otherwise accumulate across iterations. *Prereqs:* backward-pass-implementation, m10-optimization.
15. **scalar-to-tensor-vectorization**. Repackaging an entire layer's scalars into a single ndarray op (e.g., `Y = X @ W + b`) for speed. The same chain rule applies, but now gradients are matrices. *Prereqs:* rd-pass-implementation, m7-linear-algebra.
16. **matmul-backward**. For `Y = X W`: `dL/dX = (dL/dY) W^T` and `dL/dW = X^T (dL/dY)`. Derivable by summing the scalar rule over batch and output indices. *Prereqs:* scalar-to-tensor-vectorization, m7-linear-algebra.
17. **elementwise-nonlinearity-backward**. For `Y = f(X)` applied elementwise: `dL/dX = dL/dY ⊙ f'(X)`. Includes `tanh' = 1 - tanh^2`, `sigmoid' = σ(1-σ)`, `relu' = [x>0]`. *Prereqs:* scalar-to-tensor-vectorization, m11-neural-networks.
18. **broadcasting-gradient**. When a tensor is broadcast in the forward pass (e.g., bias vector added to every row), its backward gradient must be summed along the broadcast axes so the shape matches the original. *Prereqs:* scalar-to-tensor-vectorization, gradient-accumulation.
19. **softmax-ce-fused-backward**. For `L = CE(softmax(z), y)` with one-hot `y`: `dL/dz = p - y`. The Jacobian of softmax times the gradient of CE collapses algebraically. *Prereqs:* matmul-backward, m11-neural-networks.
20. *ecking**. Verify analytical gradients against the centered finite-difference approximation `(f(θ+ε) − f(θ−ε)) / (2ε)` using relative error `||g_ana − g_num|| / (||g_ana|| + ||g_num||)`; expect < 1e-7 with ε≈1e-5. *Prereqs:* backward-pass-implementation.
21. **common-backprop-bugs**. Forgetting `.zero_grad()`, in-place ops corrupting saved-for-backward buffers, `detach()`/`.data` silently severing the graph, assigning (`=`) instead of accumulating (`+=`) in `_backward`, swapping `X` and `W` in matmul backward, broadcasting without un-broadcasting. *Prereqs:* backward-pass-implementation, broadcasting-gradient.
22. **autograd-as-tape**. Framing: modern libraries (PyTorch, JAX) do not do symbolic differentiation; they record a "tape" of ops during the forward pass and replay it in reverse, exactly like micrograd but with tensors. *Prereqs:* reverse-mode-autodiff, value-class.

## 2. Canonical worked examples

**Example 1. The three-variable scalar graph (Karpathy + CS231n canonical).* (a+b) \cdot c$. Evaluate at $a=2, b=-3, c=10$.
Forward: $e = a+b = -1$; $f = e \cdot c = -10$.
Backward: seed $\frac{\partial f}{\partial f}=1$; at $f=e\cdot c$ → $\frac{\partial f}{\partial e}=c=10$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial c}=e=-1$; at $e=a+b$ → $\frac{\partial f}{\partial a}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial e}\cdot 1 = 10$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial b}=10$.
*Pedagogical point:* every `+` node copies the incoming gradient to both parents; every `*` node swaps and scales. Gives the learner the two irreducible local-derivative rules. [Source](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture4.pdf)
*Most common mistake:* students forget that "local derivative times upstream" applies to *each parent* and just compute one; or they plug in $a$'s value instead of $c$'s into $\partial f/\partial a$.

**Example 2. Karpathy's one-neuron derivation.**
Problem: $o = \tanh(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b)$. Inputs $x_1=2, x_2=0, w_1=-3, w_2=1, b=6.8813735870195432$ (Karpathy's chosen constants so $o \approx 0..
Forward: $x_1 w_1 = -6$; $x_2 w_2 = 0$; $n = x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + b \approx 0.8814$; $o=\tanh(n)\approx 0.7071$.
Backward: $\frac{\partial o}{\partial o}=1$; $\frac{\partial o}{\partial n} = 1-\tanh^2(n) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$; $\frac{\partial o}{\partial b}=0.5$; $\frac{\partial o}{\partial (x_1 w_1)} = 0.5$; $\frac{\partial o}{\partial w_1} = 0.5 \cdot x_1 = 1.0$; $\frac{\partial o}{\partial x_1} = 0.5 \cdot w_1 = -1.5$; similarly $\frac{\partial o}{\partial w_2}= 0$, $\frac{\partial o}{\partial x_2}=0.5$.
*Pedagogical point:* this is *the* canonical micrograd example, it composes `*`, `+`, and a nonlinearity and teaches "gradient flows backward through the neuron." [Source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
*Most common mistake:* computing $\partial o/\partial w_2 = 0.5 \cdot x_2 = 0$ and thinking "the gradient is broken", it's correct, it's just that dead inputs produce dead weights this step.

**Example 3. A node used twice (the `+=` demo).**
Problem: $f(a) = a \cdot a$ (equivalently $b = a+a$,  \cdot a$ if you want a richer graph). At $a=3$.
Forward: $f = 9$.
Backward via the graph: the `*` node sends gradient $a$ to *each* operand, but both operands are the same `Value` object. Correct: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial a} = 2a = 6$, achieved only if `_backward` does `a.grad += out.grad * a.data` *twice* (accumulating), not assigning.
*Pedagogical point:* this is the single step where `=` vs `+=` in `_backward` becomes a bug. Karpathy dedicates an entire chapter of the video to "fixing a backprop bug when one node is used multiple times." [Source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
*Most common mistake:* writing `a.grad = out.grad * b.data` in `__mul__`, which overwrites the first contribution; the final gradient is 3 instead of 6.

**Example 4. Matrix-multiply backward (CS231n / Eli Bendersky canonical).**
Problem: $Y = X W$ with $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$, $W \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times M}$. Given $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$, derive $\frac{\partial L}{\partial X and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}$.
Derivation: write $Y_{ij} = \sum_k X_{ik} W_{kj}$, so $\frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{ik}} = \sum_j \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_{ij}} W_{kj}$, which is $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} W^\top$; similarly $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{kj}} = \sum_i X_{ik}\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_{ij}} = X^\top \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}$.
Result: $\boxed{\frac{\partial L}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} W^\top}$, $\boxed{\frac{\partial L}{\partial W} = X^\top \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}}$. [Source](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/handouts/linear-backprop.pdf) [Source](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/backpropagation-through-a-fully-connected-layer/)
*Pedagogical point:* learners don't need to derive this from Kronecker products, they just check shapes. "The only matrix product that produces the right shape is the right one." This is the gateway from scalar autodiff to tensor autodiff.
*Most common mistake:* swapping the operand order and writing $\frac{\partial L}{\ptial W} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} X^\top$, which has the wrong shape but looks plausible.

**Example 5. Softmax + cross-entropy collapse to $p - y$.**
Problem: logits $z \in \mathbb{R}^K$, softmax $p_i = e^{z_i}/\sum_k e^{z_k}$, one-hot target $y$, loss $L = -\sum_i y_i \log p_i$. Derive $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}$.
Derivation: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial p_i} = -y_i/p_i$; $\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial z_j} = p_i(\delta_{ij} - p_j)$; chain & sum: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j} = -\sum_i (y_i/p_i) \cdot p_i(\delta_{ij}-p_j) = -y_j + p_j \sum_i y_i = p_j - y_j$ (since $\sum_i y_i = 1$).
Result: $\boxed{\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = p - y}$. [Source](https://parasdahal.com/softmax-crossentropy/) [Source](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-softmax-function-and-its-derivative/)
*Pedagogical point:* an ugly Jacobian collapses to the "prediction error." This is *why* cross-entropy is paired with softmax in every modern classifier, and why the transformer's output head is trained with exactly ts gradient.
*Most common mistake:* computing the Jacobian of softmax and the gradient of log separately and multiplying matrices, correct but painful, and a production bug trap (you want a single fused op for numerical stability via log-sum-exp).

**Example 6. Broadcasting a bias vector.**
Problem: forward is $Y = XW + b$ with $X\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$, $b\in\mathbb{R}^{M}$ broadcast across the batch. Given $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$, find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b}$.
Answer: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_{n,\cdot}} \in \mathbb{R}^M$; i.e., `db = dY.sum(axis=0)`.
*Pedagogical point:* "broadcasting in the forward pass = reduce-sum in the backward pass", a universal rule ([Source](https://gumran.github.io/mgp.html)). Every tensor autodiff framework implements an "unbroadcast" helper that sums over axes that were introduced or expanded.
*Most common mistake:* returning a gradient with the same shape as $Y$. PyTorch witly let this into a parameter with a non-broadcasting shape and produce a shape error one layer later, confusing the learner about which layer is broken.

**Example 7. Diamond graph.**
Problem: $a = 2$; $b = a+1$; $c = a \cdot 3$; $d = b \cdot c$. Forward: $b=3$, $c=6$, $d=18$. Backward.
Backward: $\frac{\partial d}{\partial d}=1$; $\frac{\partial d}{\partial b}=c=6$, $\frac{\partial d}{\partial c}=b=3$. Now $a$ has two paths: via $b$ contributes $6 \cdot 1 = 6$; via $c$ contributes $3 \cdot 3 = 9$. $\frac{\partial d}{\partial a} = 15$.
*Pedagogical point:* without topological sort, you might pop `a` off the stack before both paths have contributed. Without `+=`, you'd get 6 or 9 instead of 15.
*Most common mistake:* running `a._backward()` from `b` before `c`'s gradient has been computed, then overwriting with the `c` contribution.

**Example 8. Numerical gradient check on the one-neuron net.**
Problem: verify Example 2's analytical `w1.grad = 1.0` numerically. Compute $\tilde g = (f(w_1+\varepsilon)(w_1-\varepsilon))/(2\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon = 10^{-5}$. Expect relative error < $10^{-7}$. [Source](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/DebuggingGradientChecking/)
*Pedagogical point:* gives the learner a *test harness* for every future gradient they write. Mirrors micrograd's own `test_engine.py` which checks every Value op against PyTorch. [Source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
*Most common mistake:* using the one-sided finite difference `(f(w+ε)-f(w))/ε`, which has O(ε) truncation error and won't agree to 7 digits; or using $\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$, where floating-point cancellation wrecks the numerator.

## 3. Common misconceptions

1. **"Backprop is just the chain rule."** *Why natural:* the derivation literally is the multivariable chain rule. *Why broken:* the chain rule tells you *what* each derivative is; backprop is the *algorithm* for computing all of them in one sweep without recomputing shared subexpressions. *Kill it with:* Olah's "sum over paths" combinatal-explosion picture, 9 paths vs. 6 edges, and the explicit claim: reverse-mode is the chain rule *plus* dynamic programming over a graph. [Source](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/)
2. **"The backward pass undoes the forward pass."** *Why natural:* the arrows literally reverse. *Why broken:* the backward pass doesn't unwind the computation, it *accumulates new values* (gradients) at each node using cached forward values. Killing it: show the `Value` object has *both* `.data` and `.grad`; running `.backward()` leaves `.data` untouched.
3. **"PyTorch does symbolic differentiation."** *Why natural:* it feels magic, like Mathematica. *Why broken:* PyTorch runs your Python forward code, *records a tape* of ops on Tensors, and replays it in reverse, no symbolic formula is ever built. *Kill it with:* the `autograd-as-tape` framing; show that Python `if`/`while` works inside `torch.no_grad`'s opposite because the tape just records whatever branch ran. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiktic_differentiation)
4. **"You need to derive gradients by hand for every layer."** *Why natural:* textbook derivations do exactly this. *Why broken:* if you implement `_backward` for each *primitive* op, autodiff composes them for free. *Kill it with:* build micrograd's 6 primitive backwards (+, *, **, tanh, exp, relu) and show that a 2-layer MLP's gradient falls out with zero additional derivation.
5. **"Gradients flow through any function."** *Why natural:* everything is smooth in calc class. *Why broken:* `torch.argmax`, discrete sampling, `int()` casts, comparison masks, these have zero gradient everywhere they're defined. *Kill it with:* a widget that tries to backprop through `argmax` and shows `.grad` is 0 on the parameter controlling the argmax; contrast with the "straight-through estimator" hack used in practice.
6. **"In-place ops are fine because the values still match."** *Why natural:* `x += 1` and `x = x + 1` look equivalent. *Why broken:* the autograd tape stores a *reference* to the tens it'll need in `_backward` (e.g., `tanh` stores its output to compute $1-t^2$); an in-place modification corrupts that saved buffer. *Kill it with:* an explicit before/after widget where in-place modification of a tanh's output produces a visibly wrong gradient on the weight.
7. **"`.zero_grad()` is a PyTorch quirk; the math shouldn't require it."** *Why natural:* you don't sum gradients across iterations in the derivation on paper. *Why broken:* the same `+=` that makes diamond graphs work is what forces you to explicitly zero between iterations. *Kill it with:* a training-loop widget with a toggle for `.zero_grad()`; show the loss diverging when it's off because gradient magnitudes grow linearly with step number. [Source](https://whatilearnedtoday.net/2024/09/23/intro-to-llms-andrej-karpathys-micrograd/)
8. **"Gradients and derivatives are the same thing."** *Why natural:* in 1D they literally are. *Why broken:* a gradient is a vector/tensor of partial derivatives; for autodiff purposes, `.grad` on a node is specifically $\partial L / \partial (\text{this node})$, a scalar-per-entry because $L$ is scalar. *Kill it with:* explicitly name `.grad` as "sensitivity of the loss to this number."
9. **"You can detach a tensor to fix numerical issues without affecting training."** *Why natural:* `.detach()` looks like a performance hint. *Why broken:* it severs the autograd graph, gradients will not flow through the detached tensor back to the parameters that produced it. *Kill it with:* a widget that `.detach()`s an intermediate and shows upstream `.grad` silently stays at 0.
10. **"Backprop is slow because of all the chain rule."** *Why natural:* seems like compounding multiplications. *Why broken:* reverse-mode touches each edge exactly once, so backward is roughly the same cost as forward (the constant is typically 2–3×). *Kill it with:* Olah's factoring explanation and a stopwatch in the widget. [Source](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/)
11. **"A bigger graph means more paths means more * *Why natural:* Olah's path-counting example looks combinatorial. *Why broken:* paths are summed lazily *at each node*; reverse-mode cost is linear in the number of edges, not paths. *Kill it with:* show paths exploding in the naive view, then collapse them back via the factoring animation.
12. **"Forward-mode autodiff and reverse-mode autodiff compute different things."** *Why natural:* the algorithms look completely different. *Why broken:* they compute the same Jacobian; they differ in *which direction* they traverse it. Forward is efficient for $n \ll m$; reverse is efficient for $m \ll n$; deep learning has $n$ = millions of parameters and $m = 1$ (the loss), so reverse wins. *Kill it with:* a side-by-side widget where the learner sets $(n, m)$ and watches the op count for each mode.

## 4. Interactive widget suggestions

Opinionated stance up front: **build micrograd's `Value` class scalar-by-scalar before touching tensors.** Karpathy's order is correct and I recommend preserving it. The reason: the moment you go to tensors, the learner loses the mental picture of "one node, one edge, one local derivative" and starts memorizing matrix identities. Keep scalars for Lessons A–C; earn the right to tensors in Lesson D.

### (a) `graphForgeBackprop`
- **User manipulates:** drags op tiles (`+`, `*`, `**`, `tanh`, `relu`, `exp`) onto a canvas; draws edges by click-dragging from a node's output port to another's input port; types scalar values into leaf nodes; clicks "Forward" then "Backward".
- **Live updates:** each node displays two numbers, `.data` on the left, `.grad` on the right. On Forward, `.data` values fill in via a wave animation along the edges. On Backward, `.grad` values fill in via a *reverse* wave, each edge briefly highlighting with its local derivative while the wave passes. A node used twice visibly pulses twice during the backward wave (the `+=`).
- *gible concept:** the `computational-graph` *is* the picture; the `backward-pass-implementation` is the reverse wave; `gradient-accumulation` is the double pulse.
- **Beats a slider:** the learner is *wiring* the graph, not adjusting a number, they own the topology. Every edge they wire later turns into a line of `_backward` code.
- **Prior art:** Karpathy's `draw_dot` graphviz output in the micrograd repo ([Source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)); the static backprop visualization at [sajalsharma.com/backprop-visualization](https://sajalsharma.com/backprop-visualization/); TensorFlow Playground's animated forward pass on weights ([Source](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)).

### (b) `edgeInspector`
- **User manipulates:** hovers/clicks any edge in the graph from (a); optionally scrubs a parent node's `.data` value to see the local derivative update in real time.
- **Live updates:** pops a tooltip showing the op's local-derivative formula (e.g., for edge into a `*`: "∂out/∂this = other.data ), the numeric value of the local derivative *right now*, and the contribution this edge just made to the parent's `.grad` (= upstream × local). The edge's stroke width encodes |local derivative|.
- **Tangible concept:** `local-derivative` and `upstream-vs-local-gradient` as properties of the *edge*, not the node.
- **Beats a slider:** makes the chain-rule factor on *one specific edge* a clickable object. Reading "∂/∂x = y" from a textbook teaches the rule; clicking an edge and watching its local derivative change as you scrub the sibling input teaches the *reason*.
- **Prior art:** Tensorflow.js playground's per-weight hover tooltip; Distill's "Building Blocks" interactive annotations over feature maps ([Source](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/)).

### (c) `topoSortWalkthrough`
- **User manipulates:** takes a diamond-shaped graph (Example 7 above) and drags nodes into an ordering slot at the bottom; clicks "Run backward in this order" to watch what happens; can also click "DFS build" to animae recursive construction.
- **Live updates:** the final `.grad` of each node turns green if correct, red if wrong. When an order is wrong (e.g., `a` placed before `b`), the backward pass runs, the learner watches `a.grad` get set to `6` (from the `b` path), then the `c` path attempts to contribute but `c`'s own `.grad` is still 0 because `d`'s pass hasn't hit `c` yet. Shows the *mechanism* of the bug.
- **Tangible concept:** `topological-sort` is no longer an implementation detail, it's literally the thing that makes the diamond give 15 instead of 6 or 9.
- **Beats a slider:** the learner produces the bug with their own hands before seeing the fix.
- **Prior art:** Karpathy's in-video explanation of "fixing a backprop bug when one node is used multiple times" in the spelled-out intro video ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)); the diamond-gradient discussion in [Jhidding's Micrograd in Julia post](https://jhidding.github.io/micrograd-julia/).

### (d) `valueClassBuilder`
- **User manipates:** a live Python editor running in-browser (Pyodide) with a scaffolded `Value` class; writes the body of `__mul__._backward`, `__add__._backward`, `tanh._backward` one at a time; each gated step runs a tiny test that compares to PyTorch.
- **Live updates:** the test output goes green (matches PyTorch to 1e-7) or red (with a specific diff); the graph-viz visualization updates with the learner's current implementation applied to a fixed expression.
- **Tangible concept:** `per-op-backward-closures` and the entire `value-class`: the learner is literally writing the engine.
- **Beats a slider:** it *is* the keystone moment. The learner's own code is executed and compared to a reference.
- **Prior art:** Karpathy's `test_engine.py` in micrograd ([Source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)); Selenium-style notebook builds like [Ryan Killian's Karpathy workbooks](https://github.com/ryankillian/karpathy-lectures-notebooks).

### (e) `broadcastReducer`
- **User manipulates:** drags to choose an input sha ($N, M$) and a bias-vector shape ($M$), hits "forward" to see broadcasting, then hits "backward" and must click the axes to *sum over*. If they skip an axis, the framework refuses to complete the backward (shape mismatch) and displays the `unbroadcast` logic they missed.
- **Live updates:** shape badges on each tensor in the DAG; an "unbroadcast" node visibly appears on the backward edge once the learner correctly identifies the broadcast axes.
- **Tangible concept:** `broadcasting-gradient`: "broadcast forward, reduce backward."
- **Beats a slider:** the shape mismatch *is* the lesson; the learner feels the error in their fingers.
- **Prior art:** PyTorch error messages as the de facto negative teacher; [Douglas Orr's autodiff-from-scratch post](https://douglasorr.github.io/2021-11-autodiff/article.html) explicitly names the "broadcast → reduce-sum" duality.

### (f) `forwardVsReverseRaceTrack`
- **User manipulates:** drags sliders for `n` (input dim) and `m` (output dim) of a random DAG; hits "Race,ich runs forward-mode autodiff (one sweep per input) and reverse-mode (one sweep per output) side by side, counting edge visits.
- **Live updates:** two counters tick up live; at the end, two bars show total ops. The color of each mode darkens as its cost dominates. A toggle "Loss function mode" pins $m=1$ and shows reverse-mode as a flat line while forward-mode blows up with $n$.
- **Tangible concept:** `why-reverse-mode-for-dl`: the one-slide reason deep learning picked reverse.
- **Beats a slider:** the slider alone would just be a number; the race lets the learner *feel* the asymmetry.
- **Prior art:** MIT 18.S096 lecture notes on forward vs. reverse mode ([Source](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-matrix-calculus-for-machine-learning-and-beyond-january-iap-2023/mit18_s096iap23_lec08.pdf)); the auto-eD visualization tool ([Source](https://auto-ed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mod3.html)).

### (g) `gradientCheckBench`
- **User manipulates:** writes (or inherits from Lesson C) a custom `_backward` for a w op (say, `sin`); runs "Grad check," which perturbs each input by ε and compares to the analytical gradient; can scrub ε on a log scale.
- **Live updates:** a log-log plot of relative error vs. ε appears with a characteristic "U" curve, truncation error dominates at large ε, round-off at small ε. A green band at $10^{-7}$ relative error confirms correctness; the sweet spot around $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-5}$ is highlighted.
- **Tangible concept:** `gradient-checking` as a *test*, plus the numerical reality of floating point.
- **Beats a slider:** the slider *has* meaning, the learner discovers the U-curve empirically, which is the whole pedagogical point.
- **Prior art:** Stanford's UFLDL gradient-check page ([Source](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/DebuggingGradientChecking/)); Andrew Ng's "fraud-detection" gradient check assignment in the Deep Learning specialization.

## 5. Key formulas

**Chain rule on a graph**
```
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = \sum_{y \in \text{chil \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\,\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
```
```
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\cdot\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
```
```
\text{grad}_x \mathrel{+}= \text{grad}_y \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
```

**Scalar backward rules per op** (given `out = op(a, b)` with upstream gradient `g = ∂L/∂out`)
```
c = a + b: \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial a}\mathrel{+}= g,\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}\mathrel{+}= g

## 6. Lesson decomposition

Five lessons. Spine follows Karpathy's order because it's the right order: scalars build the mental model, tensors then slot in as "the same thing, faster." Total estimated seat time: ~2.5–3 hours of active learner time, i.e., Karpathy's video, chunked and gated.

### Lesson 12.1: "Draw the graph"
- **Summary:** Take any expression you already know how to evaluate and turn it into a graph you can walk node by node.
- **Steps (≈ 45–55 min):**
  1. *Prose-widget.* The three-node graph for $f = (a+b)\cdot c$; click each node to evaluate. [uses `graphForgeBackprop`]
 2. *Prose.* "Values live on nodes, opive on edges, and every edge has a local derivative."
  3. *StepCheck.* With $a=2, b=-3, c=10$, what is $f$? **Answer: -10.**
  4. *Widget.* Click each edge to see its local derivative. [uses `edgeInspector`]
  5. *StepCheck.* On the edge from $e$ to $f$ (with $f = e\cdot c$), what is $\partial f/\partial e$? **Answer: 10 (i.e., $c$).**
  6. *Prose.* The sum-over-paths rule; visual of the diamond graph from Olah.
  7. *Widget.* Build your own graph for $f(x,y) = xy + \sin(x)$ at $x=\pi/2, y=2$. Evaluate forward.
  8. *StepCheck.* What is $f$? **Answer: $\pi + 1 \approx 4.1416$.**
  9. *Prose.* Endgame callback.
- **Widgets used:** `graphForgeBackprop`, `edgeInspector`.

### Lesson 12.2: "Walk it backward"
- **Summary:** The backward pass is a reverse sweep of the same graph, propagating one gradient per node.
- **Steps (≈ 45–55 min):**
  1. *Prose.* Seed `dL/dL = 1`. Every node gets a `.grad`.
  2. *Widget.* Run backward on the $(a+b)\cdot c$ graph; watch gradients flow. [uses `graphForgeBackprop`StepCheck.* What is $\partial f/\partial a$ with $c=10$? **Answer: 10.**
  4. *StepCheck.* What is $\partial f/\partial b$? **Answer: 10.** (Teaches that `+` copies.)
 5. *Prose-widget.* The one-neuron example $o = \tanh(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b)$. Karpathy's canonical setup with $x_1=2, x_2=0, w_1=-3, w_2=1$.
  6. *StepCheck.* With $n \approx 0.8814$, what is $1 - \tanh^2(n)$ (to 2 decimals)? **Answer: 0.50.**
  7. *StepCheck.* What is $\partial o/\partial w_1$? **Answer: 1.0.**
  8. *Prose.* The diamond graph; why a naïve recursive backward gives the wrong answer.
  9. *Widget.* Misorder the nodes of the diamond on purpose; watch the bug. [uses `topoSortWalkthrough`]
  10. *Prose.* Topological sort as the fix. One sentence, one picture.
  11. *StepCheck.* In Example 7's diamond, $\partial d/\partial a = ?$ **Answer: 15.**
  12. *Prose.* Endgame callback.
- **Widgets used:** `graphForgeBackprop`, `topoSortWalkthrough`.

### Lesson 12.3: "Build the Value class"
- **Summary:** Now write the code. Every grou've walked by hand becomes a `Value` object with a `_backward` closure.
- **Steps (≈ 45–55 min):**
  1. *Prose.* Intro the `Value` dataclass: `.data`, `.grad`, `._prev`, `._op`, `._backward`. Show the complete skeleton (no backwards filled in). [Source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/micrograd/engine.py)
  2. *Widget.* Write `__add__._backward`. Hit run; tested against PyTorch. [uses `valueClassBuilder`]
  3. *Widget.* Write `__mul__._backward`. (This is the moment `+=` appears for the first time; point out the `a*a` case.)
 4. *StepCheck, interpretation.* "Why `+=` and not `=` inside `_backward`?" *Free-text or multiple choice; canonical answer: a node can be used multiple times, contributions must be summed.*
  5. *Widget.* Write `__pow__._backward`, `exp._backward`, `tanh._backward`.
  6. *Prose.* The top-level `backward()` method: build topo, seed `1.0`, iterate in reverse.
  7. *Widget.* Implement the topological sort via DFS; tests run on the diamond graph.
  8. *Widget.* a tiny 2-input, 1-hidden-layer MLP to fit a single sample (binary classifier on moons), manually looping over parameters and calling `p.data -= 0.05 * p.grad`. Plot the loss decreasing.
  9. *Prose.* Zero the grads. Show the bug Karpathy himself made on camera (gradients accumulating across iterations), and the fix. [Source](https://whatilearnedtoday.net/2024/09/23/intro-to-llms-andrej-karpathys-micrograd/)
 10. *StepCheck, debugging.* Given buggy training code missing `.zero_grad()`, what do gradients look like after 3 iterations compared to 1? *Canonical answer: ≈3× too large.*
  11. *Prose.* Endgame callback. You just built micrograd.
- **Widgets used:** `valueClassBuilder`.

### Lesson 12.4: "From scalars to tensors"
- **Summary:** Stack 64 scalars into a vector, stack 768 vectors into a matrix, and the forward and backward rules still hold, but now `dL/dW` is a matrix.
- **Steps (≈ 30–40 min):**
  1. *Prose.* The scaling problem: a `Neuron` with 768 inputs and 64 outputs would be 768×parate `Value` objects. One matmul op does it in one line and is ~1000× faster on a GPU.
  2. *Prose-widget.* Derive `dL/dX = dL/dY @ W.T` and `dL/dW = X.T @ dL/dY` by checking shapes. Show the index-sum derivation as an optional reveal.
  3. *StepCheck.* Given `X.shape = (32, 100)`, `W.shape = (100, 10)`, `dY.shape = (32, 10)`, what shape is `dW`? **Answer: (100, 10).**
  4. *Widget.* Implement `matmul.backward` in a tensor micrograd stub; test vs PyTorch.
 5. *Prose.* Elementwise nonlinearities, same rule as before, just tensor-wise. `dL/dX = dL/dY * f'(X)`.
  6. *Widget.* Bias broadcasting: forward is easy, backward requires summing along the batch axis. [uses `broadcastReducer`]
  7. *StepCheck.* Given `dY.shape = (32, 64)` and bias shape `(64,)`, what is `db`? *Canonical: `dY.sum(axis=0)`, shape `(64,)`.*
  8. *Prose.* The famous softmax+CE collapse: derive $p - y$.
  9. *StepCheck.* For logits $[2.0, 1.0, 0.1]$ and target $y = [1, 0, 0]$, compute $p - y$ to 3 decimals. *Canonical: $[-0.341, 0.242.099]$.*
  10. *Prose.* Endgame callback.
- **Widgets used:** `broadcastReducer`, `valueClassBuilder` (tensor mode).

### Lesson 12.5: "Check it, break it, fix it"
- **Summary:** Every autodiff bug is caught by a gradient check or diagnosed by knowing the four classic footguns.
- **Steps (≈ 30–40 min):**
  1. *Prose.* Why gradient checks: subtly buggy backwards still train (Karpathy: "the model still worked"). Fraud detection framing from Andrew Ng's assignment.
  2. *Widget.* The two-sided finite-difference formula; the U-curve of error vs. ε. [uses `gradientCheckBench`]
  3. *StepCheck.* At what ε (to one significant figure) is the minimum error? **Answer: ~1e-5.**
  4. *Widget.* Write a grad-check that asserts relative error < 1e-7; run it on your `tanh._backward` from lesson 12.3.
  5. *Prose.* The debugging hall of shame: missing `.zero_grad()`, in-place ops, `.detach()`, swapped matmul operands, broadcast axes.
 6. *StepCheck, debugging.* Spot the bug: given `dW = dY @ X.T` with shapes `(`(N,D)`, why is this wrong? *Canonical: should be `X.T @ dY`.*
 7. *StepCheck, debugging.* Spot the bug: `def _backward(): self.grad = out.grad * other.data`. *Canonical: should be `+=`.*
 8. *StepCheck, debugging.* After `x = x * 2` inside a `torch.no_grad()` block, will gradients flow? *Canonical: no.*
 9. *Prose.* Forward vs reverse autodiff side-by-side, why deep learning uses reverse mode.
  10. *Widget.* Race forward vs reverse on random DAGs as a function of $(n, m)$. [uses `forwardVsReverseRaceTrack`]
  11. *Prose.* Final endgame callback. The learner has just built the engine that trains every neural network on earth.
- **Widgets used:** `gradientCheckBench`, `forwardVsReverseRaceTrack`.

## 7. Problem bank

1. **[novice / computation / computational-graph, chain-rule-on-a-graph]** For $f(a,b,c) = (a+b)\cdot c$ with $a=2, b=-3, c=10$, compute $\partial f/\partial a$, $\partial f/\partial b$, $\partial f/\partial c$. *Answer:* 10, 10, −1.

2. **[novice / computation / local-derivative]y = x_1 \cdot x_2$, give both local derivatives. *Answer:* $\partial y/\partial x_1 = x_2$, $\partial y/\partial x_2 = x_1$.

3. **[novice / computation / chain-rule-on-a-graph]** For $g(x) = \tanh(3x + 1)$ at $x=0$, compute $g'(0)$. *Answer:* $(1-\tanh^2(1))\cdot 3 \approx 3 \cdot 0.41998 \approx 1.2600$.

4. **[novice / computation / local-derivative]** Give the local derivative of $y = \text{ReLU}(x)$ at $x = -0.3$ and at $x = 2.1$. *Answer:* 0 and 1.

5. **[novice / computation / chain-rule-on-a-graph]** For $f(x,y) = xy + \sin(x)$ at $(x,y)=(\pi/2, 2)$, compute the gradient. *Answer:* $(\partial f/\partial x,\partial f/\partial y) = (y + \cos(x), x) = (2, \pi/2)$.

6. **[intermediate / computation / gradient-accumulation]** For $f(a) = a \cdot a + a$ at $a=4$, use the graph to compute $f'(a)$ by identifying each path's contribution. *Answer:* $2a + 1 = 9$; contributions are $a$ (from left `*`), $a$ (from right `*`), $1$ (from `+`).

7. **[intermediate / construction / per-op-backward-closures]** Write the `_backward` closure in Python for `out = a ** n` (n constant, a a Value). *Answer:*
    ```python
    def _backward():
        a.grad += (n * a.data**(n-1)) * out.grad
    ```

8. **[intermediate / computation / chain-rule-on-a-graph]** For the neuron $o=\tanh(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b)$ at $x_1=2, x_2=0, w_1=-3, w_2=1, b\approx 6.8814$, compute $\partial o/\partial x_1$. *Answer:* $(1-\tanh^2(n))\cdot w_1 = 0.5 \cdot (-3) = -1.5$.

9. **[intermediate / debugging / common-backprop-bugs]** The following `_backward` for multiplication is buggy. Find the bug and fix it.
    ```python
    def _backward():
        self.grad = out.grad * other.data
        other.grad = out.grad * self.data
    ```
    *Answer:* `=` should be `+=` on both lines; otherwise, when `self` or `other` is a leaf used by multiple parents, contributions from other paths get clobbered.

10. **[intermediate / computation / matmul-backward]** Given $Y = XW$ with `X.shape = (64, 128)`, `W.shape = (128, 10)`, `dL/dY.shape = (64, 10)`, what are the shapes of `dL/dX` and `dL/dW`, and how are they computed? *Answer:* `dL/dX.shape = (64, 128) = dL/dY @ W.T`; `dL/dW.shape = (128, 10) = X.T @ dL/dY`.

11. **[intermediate / computation / softmax-ce-fused-backward]** For logits $z = [2.0, 1.0, 0.1]$ and one-hot target $y = [1, 0, 0]$, compute $\partial L/\partial z$ to 3 decimals. *Answer:* $p = [0.659, 0.242, 0.099]$; $p - y = [-0.341, 0.242, 0.099]$.

12. **[intermediate / computation / broadcasting-gradient]** Forward: `Y = X + b` with `X.shape = (32, 10)`, `b.shape = (10,)` (broadcast along batch). Given `dL/dY.shape = (32, 10)`, what is `dL/db` and its shape? *Answer:* `dL/db = dL/dY.sum(axis=0)`, shape `(10,)`.

13. **[intermediate / debugging / topological-sort]** A learner's `backward()` method calls `_backward` in the insertion order of `_prev` rather than topo order. On a diamond $d = b \cdot c,\ b = a+1,\ c = 3a$, a = 2, what (wrong) gradient might they compute for `a`? Explain. *Answer:* Likely 6 or 9 instead of 15, whichever path's contrition gets overwritten or runs before the other has propagated into the shared parent.

14. **[intermediate / debugging / common-backprop-bugs]** In a training loop:
    ```python
    for epoch in range(100):
        loss = model(x).loss(y)
        loss.backward()
        for p in model.parameters():
            p.data -= 0.1 * p.grad
    ```
    Why does the loss diverge after a few iterations? *Answer:* `.grad` is never zeroed; after $k$ iterations, the gradient used is effectively the sum of all past gradients, ≈k× the correct magnitude, so the step size grows without bound.

15. **[advanced / construction / value-class]** Implement a complete `Value.__truediv__` (division) that correctly supports backward. Use only previously-defined ops. *Answer:* `return self * other**-1`; relies on `__mul__` and `__pow__` being correct. This gives `da/d(a/b) = 1/b` and `db/d(a/b) = -a/b^2` for free.

16. **[advanced / proof-scaffold / why-reverse-mode-for-dl]** Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be computed by AG with $E$ edges. State and justify: (a) the cost of forward-mode autodiff; (b) the cost of reverse-mode; (c) why deep learning uses reverse mode. *Answer:* (a) $O(n\cdot E)$; (b) $O(m\cdot E)$; (c) in deep learning $m=1$ (scalar loss) while $n$ is in the millions or billions, so reverse is cheaper by a factor of $n$.

17. **[advanced / debugging / common-backprop-bugs]** A student's custom `ReLU._backward` is:
    ```python
    def _backward():
        self.grad += out.grad * (out.data > 0)
    ```
 Gradient check says "relative error 3e-3", bad. Identify the bug. *Answer:* The indicator should be on the *input* `self.data > 0`, not on the output `out.data > 0`. For ReLU they coincide *except* at $x=0^-$ vs $x=0$; more importantly, if the op were ever `LeakyReLU` the distinction matters, and the student's conceptual model is wrong. (Acceptable alternate answer: both are equivalent for standard ReLU, but the numerical error comes from a different source, e.g., a different line.)

18. **[advanced /struction / scalar-to-tensor-vectorization]** Write a vectorized forward and backward for a single linear layer `Y = X @ W + b` using only numpy (not PyTorch). Include shape comments. *Answer:*
    ```python
    # forward; X:(N,D), W:(D,M), b:(M,)
    Y = X @ W + b                    # (N, M)
    # given dY:(N,M), backward:
    dX = dY @ W.T                    # (N, D)
    dW = X.T @ dY                    # (D, M)
    db = dY.sum(axis=0)              # (M,)
    ```

19. **[advanced / interpretation / autograd-as-tape]** In PyTorch, `x = torch.tensor([1., 2.], requires_grad=True)`, `y = x.detach() * 3; y.sum().backward()`. What is `x.grad`? Explain. *Answer:* `None` (or all zeros). `.detach()` returns a tensor that shares storage but is *not* part of the autograd graph, so gradient flow from `y` stops at the detach boundary; `x` receives no contribution.

20. **[advanced / debugging / matmul-backward, scalar-to-tensor-vectorization]** A learner writes `dW = dY @ X.T` and their gradient check fails with 100% relative error. The shapes happen to be compatible because the problem has `N = D`. What's the bug and how would they have caught it before a grad check? *Answer:* Correct formula is `dW = X.T @ dY` (the operand order matters; matmul isn't commutative). They'd catch it earlier by testing with non-square matrices where `N ≠ D`: the incorrect formula would throw a shape error immediately.

## 8. Endgame callback: refined

Starter: *"You just built micrograd. loss.backward() is no longer magic, it's your code."*

Candidates, in ascending order of my preference:

**C1.** *"You just built micrograd. Every deep-learning framework on earth. PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, is a faster, GPU-aware version of what you just wrote by hand. `loss.backward()` is no longer magic; it's your code."*

**C2.** *"Before this module, `loss.backward()` was a call into someone else's library. Now it's a reverse walk of a graph you built, running closures you wrote. Everything from a 2-parameter fit to a 70-billion-paramins on this exact algorithm."*

**C3 (recommended).** *"Every neural network on earth, every GPT, every diffusion model, every AlphaFold, is trained by the algorithm you just implemented in about 100 lines of Python. The rest is efficiency."*

Why C3 wins: it (a) lands the keystone emotionally (the learner has joined a club), (b) uses concrete brand-name models the learner knows, (c) echoes Karpathy's own canonical line "the rest is just efficiency" ([Source](http://karpathy.github.io/2026/02/12/microgpt/)) which becomes an inside-reference the learner will recognize the first time they watch his video, and (d) is short enough to be the tab-closer at the bottom of every lesson in the module.

## 10. Pedagogical traps

1. **"It's just the chain rule" framing.** *What happens:* the instructor correctly reduces backprop to the chain rule and thinks pedagogical victory has been achieved. The learner leaves with a formula but cannot implement backprop for a graph they haven't seen. *Why it happens:* the chain rule *is* the math; the pedagogical content is everything else, the graph, the topo sort, the `+=`, the tape. *Mitigation:* the first step of Lesson 12.1 is "draw the graph", before any formula appears. Introduce the chain rule only *after* the learner has manually walked one graph forward and one backward. Explicitly say "backprop = chain rule + dynamic programming over a DAG" and build each word in order.

2. **Jumping to vectorized/tensor backward formulas before scalar is rock solid.** *What happens:* the learner memorizes "$X^\top dY$" as a pattern but can't reconstruct it when the shapes or indices are unusual. *Why it happens:* tensor notation is compact and tempting. *Mition:* hard constraint, no tensors until Lesson 12.4. Karpathy's order. All of 12.1–12.3 lives at the scalar level. When tensors arrive, derive `dW = X.T @ dY` by shape-checking and by index-sum from the scalar rule, in that order.

3. **Hand-waving "and PyTorch handles the rest."** *What happens:* at the very moment the learner is about to cross over to "ML implementer," the instructor shortcuts to the library, and the keystone moment evaporates. *Why it happens:* the material is long and the temptation to "efficiency-bump" is strong. *Mitigation:* Lesson 12.3's final StepCheck is *writing the top-level `backward()`*. Do not mention PyTorch until Lesson 12.4, and when you do, frame it as "the same thing, vectorized, on a GPU." The endgame callback (Section 8, C3) is the moment that pays this off.

4. **Over-indexing on the math derivation, under-indexing on the implementation.** *What happens:* the learner can derive softmax+CE → p−y on paper but freezes when asked to write the 6-line `softmax_ce._`. *Why it happens:* math-first instincts from a calc background. *Mitigation:* every lesson has a "write the code" widget step (`valueClassBuilder`) and at least one StepCheck that is an *implementation*, not a derivation. The assessment bank (Section 7) is roughly 40% computation, 25% construction/implementation, 20% debugging, 15% interpretation, over-weight the practical.

5. **Skipping topological sort as "an implementation detail."** *What happens:* diamond-shaped graphs (which every MLP contains, every weight is used by many outputs) produce mysteriously wrong gradients. *Why it happens:* on linear-chain graphs the recursive naive backward happens to produce the right order. *Mitigation:* Lesson 12.2 specifically builds a diamond, specifically runs a naive backward, specifically produces the wrong number, and only then introduces topo sort. The `topoSortWalkthrough` widget makes the bug physical. Karpathy issue #67 on his own repo catches a topo bug in the wild, worth citing. [Source](https:ub.com/karpathy/micrograd/issues/67)

6. **Not making the learner physically watch gradients accumulate.** *What happens:* the learner writes `self.grad = ...` instead of `self.grad += ...` on their first try, it passes trivial tests, and breaks silently on any graph where a node is used twice (i.e., all of them, once you include bias or residual connections). *Why it happens:* `=` is the instinctive Python reflex, and most pedagogical examples never revisit a node. *Mitigation:* Example 3 in Section 2 is explicitly `f(a) = a*a`: the minimal graph that exposes the bug. The `graphForgeBackprop` widget animates the *double pulse* on a reused node. The StepCheck in Lesson 12.3 step 4 asks the learner to explain why `+=` is necessary, in their own words, before they continue.

7. **(Bonus) Letting the learner believe autograd is symbolic.** *What happens:* the learner assumes PyTorch builds an algebraic formula, so Python control flow should break it, so they write awkward tensor-only code to avoid `if`. *Whit happens:* every previous exposure (Mathematica, SymPy, Wolfram Alpha) has been symbolic. *Mitigation:* the `autograd-as-tape` concept in Section 1 (item 22) is introduced explicitly in Lesson 12.5, with a widget step that runs the same function with different `if` branches and shows the tape recording whichever branch executed. Wikipedia's AD article is a good vocabulary anchor. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)
