# Deep-Research Prompt Pack — Tinker Course Content

> **Purpose:** Batch-commission the raw pedagogical material for every unwritten module. Fire one prompt per module into Deep Research (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity — any). Paste the output into this repo; Claude Code converts it into MDX lessons + Svelte widgets.

## Workflow

1. **Fire** one per-module prompt into Deep Research.
2. **Save** the response to `docs/research/m{N}-{slug}.md` verbatim.
3. **Queue** a Claude Code session: "Convert `docs/research/m7-linear-algebra.md` into the 4–6 MDX lessons it describes, following our existing Step / StepCheck / EndgameCallback patterns."
4. I generate lesson drafts + widget specs. Human edits for voice.
5. Ship the module.

Per-module work units: one research fire, one conversion pass, one editing pass, one deploy. Independent per module — multiple can run in parallel (one research tool per module, Claude Code converts them as results land).

## What Deep Research can't do

- **Our voice.** Research outputs read like surveys. We need tight, opinionated, hungover-adult-friendly prose. I do this pass.
- **Our widgets.** Research describes interactions; it can't build a Svelte+Mafs component that drags a vector and updates a dot product. That's me + the svelte-mafs library.
- **The narrative spine.** "This IS `loss.backward()`." "This IS attention." The endgame callback threaded through every module is ours to enforce.
- **License gatekeeping.** Research will happily cite Khan Academy (CC BY-NC-SA) or Wikipedia (CC BY-SA). We reject both for commercial content. The prompt below locks this down.

# Research brief: Tinker Module {{ORDER}} — {{TITLE}}

## Role

You are a world-class mathematics educator and interactive-pedagogy researcher. You have read Bret Victor's "Learnable Programming," Nicky Case's essays on explorable explanations, the full Distill.pub archive, every 3Blue1Brown Essence-of-X series, and Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero." You understand the difference between a "boring slider" (a labeled number whose only purpose is to wiggle) and a direct-manipulation widget where the learner is grabbing the mathematical object itself.

## Context

I am building an interactive online course called Tinker: "Machine Learning, Backpropagation, and AI — The Math." It takes adult technical learners (think: software engineers who took calc a decade ago and want to actually understand ML from the math up) from pre-algebra to training a tiny character-level transformer in the browser via WebGPU.

The course has 18 modules across 5 arcs. Every module must pay back to the transformer endpoint via a 1–2 sentence "Where this shows up in the transformer" callback.

Stack: Astro 6 + Svelte 5 + MDX + a custom Svelte+Mafs widget library + KaTeX for math. Each lesson is 8–15 gated steps; some steps are prose-with-widget, some are StepCheck (numeric-answer gate before advance). The closest thing to a model of what a "good" lesson looks like is 3Blue1Brown's visual rigor married to Karpathy's build-something-from-scratch concreteness.

## Module under research

- **Module order:** {{ORDER}}
- **Module title:** {{TITLE}}
- **Arc:** {{ARC}}
- **Assumed prior knowledge (already taught earlier in the course):** {{PRIOR}}
- **Must-cover concepts:** {{CONCEPTS}}
- **Immediate next module:** {{NEXT_MODULE}}
- **Endgame callback (the one-liner at the bottom of every lesson in this module):** {{ENDGAME}}

## Deliverables — return ONE response with exactly these 10 sections, in order. No preamble.

### 1. Concept dependency graph
10–25 specific concepts this module must cover, topologically sorted.
For each: concept id (kebab-case), one-sentence definition, direct prerequisites (from this module or earlier — use module ids like `m5-calculus`).

### 2. Canonical worked examples
6–10 worked examples that are the "default teaching examples" for these concepts across MIT OCW, Stanford CS courses, Karpathy's videos, 3B1B, and Mathematics for Machine Learning (Deisenroth/Faisal/Ong).
For each: problem statement (LaTeX-ready), step-by-step solution, the pedagogical point it makes, the single most common student mistake on this example.

### 3. Common misconceptions
8–12 specific wrong mental models adult learners arrive with for this topic.
For each: the misconception in one sentence, why it's natural to fall for, and the specific counterexample, reframe, or visualization that kills it.

### 4. Interactive widget suggestions
4–7 widget ideas specific to this module's concepts.
For each:
- **Name** (camelCase, ≤25 chars)
- **What the user manipulates directly** (drag what, scrub what, click what)
- **What updates live** (specific readouts, visual changes)
- **What concept it makes tangible** (the pedagogical moment)
- **Why it beats a slider + static figure** (the Bret Victor / Nicky Case test)
- **Prior art** — 1–3 existing widgets on the web that do something similar (URLs if known)

Reject any idea that reduces to "drag a slider, watch an unlabeled number change." Every widget must let the learner grab a mathematical object the lesson has already named.

### 5. Key formulas
Every formula a student must recognize and/or reproduce.
Return as LaTeX source strings ready to drop into MDX (e.g. `\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}`). No commentary per formula — just the list, grouped by concept.

### 6. Lesson decomposition
Propose 3–6 lessons this module should split into. For each lesson:
- **Title** (conversational, not textbook — e.g. "What is a derivative?" not "1.1 Introduction to differentiation")
- **Summary** (one sentence, learner-facing)
- **Step outline** (8–15 gated steps, each a title + one-line description; note which steps are StepCheck with the expected scalar answer)
- **Widgets it uses** (refs to section 4)
- **Estimated minutes**

### 7. Problem bank
20 assessment problems ranging novice → advanced.
For each:
- Statement (LaTeX-ready)
- Expected answer (scalar, symbolic, or multi-part)
- Difficulty tier: novice / intermediate / advanced
- Cognitive type: computation / interpretation / construction / debugging / proof-scaffold
- Concept tags (from section 1)

### 8. Endgame callback — refined
Propose 1–3 candidate one-liners for the module's endgame callback. I supplied a starter; give me better options.

### 9. Sources (licensing-aware)
5–10 best external resources for this module.
For each: title, author, URL, medium (textbook / paper / video / blog / widget), license if known, and what specifically to use it for (worked examples / pedagogy reference / visualization inspiration).

**CRITICAL LICENSE RULES:**
- We are a **paid commercial product**.
- **DO NOT** recommend CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-SA, or unlicensed content for **incorporation or adaptation**.
- Khan Academy content: CC BY-NC-SA → reference-only, never adapt.
- Wikipedia / Wikibooks: CC BY-SA → reference-only.
- MIT OCW: CC BY-NC-SA → reference-only.
- **OK to adapt:** CC BY, public domain, US federal government, OpenStax books that are CC BY (verify per-book — some OpenStax are NC-SA).
- Every source must be tagged **[ADAPT]** (we can reuse) or **[REFERENCE-ONLY]** (inspiration, don't embed).

### 10. Pedagogical traps
4–6 specific things that commonly go wrong when teaching this topic to adult self-learners.
For each: the trap, why it happens, and the concrete lesson-design mitigation.

## Style constraints

- Be opinionated. If two standard approaches exist, recommend one and say why.
- Target an adult technical audience (software engineers, engineers, scientists). High-school math is a distant memory but not a wall.
- Prefer construction and manipulation over multiple choice.
- Every widget must pass the "could this be a slider with a number on it?" test. If the answer is yes, reject it.
- Markdown-only. No tables requiring complex rendering.

## Per-module parameter blocks

Fire one at a time. Paste the master template above, then replace `{{...}}` tokens with the block below.

### M6 — Multivariable Calculus — Partial Derivatives, Gradients, Jacobians

```
ORDER: 6
TITLE: Multivariable Calculus — Partial Derivatives, Gradients, Jacobians
ARC: Arc 1 — Prerequisite Math
MINUTES: 150
PRIOR: Single-variable derivatives, chain rule, power rule (m5-calculus). Vectors as lists of numbers and dot products (m7-linear-algebra).
CONCEPTS: functions of multiple variables, partial derivatives, gradient, directional derivative, level sets, Jacobian, chain rule for composed multivariable functions, Hessian (intuition only)
NEXT_MODULE: m7-linear-algebra (linear algebra — vectors, matrices as transformations, matrix multiplication)
ENDGAME: loss.backward() computes the gradient of loss with respect to every parameter. That's the Jacobian-vector product you're about to implement by hand.
```

### M7 — Linear Algebra

```
ORDER: 7
TITLE: Linear Algebra
ARC: Arc 1 — Prerequisite Math
MINUTES: 240
PRIOR: Algebra and function composition (m2-algebra). Can be taken in parallel with multivariable calculus (m6).
CONCEPTS: vectors as arrows and lists, vector addition and scaling, dot product (as similarity and projection), matrices as linear transformations of space, matrix-vector multiplication as linear combination of columns, matrix-matrix multiplication as composition, determinant geometrically (signed area/volume), eigenvalues and eigenvectors, singular value decomposition (intuition: best low-rank approximation), change of basis
NEXT_MODULE: m8-probability and m10-optimization (both depend on linear algebra)
ENDGAME: A transformer is x @ W_q, x @ W_k, x @ W_v, then dot products through softmax, then more matrix multiplies. The attention matrix is a dot-product similarity matrix. Linear algebra is 80% of the transformer.
```

### M10 — Optimization

```
ORDER: 10
TITLE: Optimization
ARC: Arc 2 — ML Foundations

NEXT_MODULE: m11-neural-networks (applying optimization to learn MLP parameters)
ENDGAME: Adam is the optimizer you'll actually use to train the transformer. The LR warmup schedule, the betas, the epsilon — all of it has reasons, and you'll understand them.
```

### M11 — Neural Network Fundamentals

```
ORDER: 11
TITLE: Neural Network Fundamentals
ARC: Arc 2 — ML Foundations
MINUTES: 150
PRIOR: Linear algebra (m7), optimization (m10). Light exposure to the chain rule (m5).
CONCEPTS: perceptron, linear layer with bias, activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, GELU), single-layer limitations (the XOR problem), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), forward pass as a stack of (matmul + nonlinearity), universal approximation theorem (intuition only, no proof), decision boundaries
NEXT_MODULE: m12-backpropagation (how MLPs actually learn their weights)
ENDGAME: The transformer's feed-forward block is literally an MLP. Everything you learn here plugs directly into the transformer architecture two modules from now.
```

### M12 — Backpropagation from Scratch (THE KEYSTONE)

```
ORDER: 12
TITLE: Backpropagation from Scratch
ARC: Arc 2 — ML Foundations
MINUTES: 240
PRIOR: Chain rule (m5-calculus), gradients (m6-multivariable), linear algebra (m7), MLPs (m11-neural-networks).
CONCEPTS: computational graph (nodes = values, edges = ops), forward pass as graph evaluation, local derivatives at each node, reverse-mode automatic differentiation, chain rule applied across the graph, building micrograd scalar-by-scalar (Karpathy-style), vectorizing from scalars to tensors, gradient checking (numerical vs analytical), common backprop bugs (missing .zero_grad(), in-place ops, detached tensors)
NEXT_MODULE: m13-training-dynamics (stabilizing the training of deep nets — BatchNorm, dropout, residuals)
ENDGAME: You just built micrograd. Every deep-learning framework on earth is a fancier version of what you now understand end-to-end. loss.backward() is no longer magic — it's your code.
```

### M14 — Sequence Modeling: Bigrams to RNNs

```
ORDER: 14
TITLE: Sequence Modeling — Bigrams to RNNs
ARC: Arc 3 — Language Models
MINUTES: 390
PRIOR: Linear algebra, matmul, softmax (m7). Gradient descent, Adam, schedules (m10). MLP forward/backward (m11). Backprop on a computational graph (m12). Training dynamics — initialization, normalization, residuals, regularization (m13).
CONCEPTS: characters/tokens as a vocabulary, sequence as a sample from a joint distribution, factoring P(sequence) via the chain rule of probability, bigram language model as a lookup table of next-token probabilities, training a bigram by counting AND by gradient descent on a single embedding-then-softmax layer (showing they converge to the same thing), negative log-likelihood as the loss, perplexity as exp(loss) and what it intuitively measures, sampling from a categorical distribution (greedy vs temperature vs top-k), context windows and the bigram→trigram→n-gram explosion, replacing the n-gram table with a small MLP (Bengio 2003-style) that consumes a fixed-width context of token embeddings, the embedding matrix as a learned lookup, fixed-context limitations, recurrent neural networks: a hidden state that ingests one token at a time and carries information forward, the RNN cell as h_t = tanh(W_x x_t + W_h h_{t-1} + b), training RNNs with backprop-through-time (intuition; concrete unrolling for a 3-step example), vanishing and exploding gradients in long sequences (callback to m13), the sequential-bottleneck failure mode that motivates attention
NEXT_MODULE: m15-attention (queries, keys, values; scaled dot-product attention; multi-head attention)
ENDGAME: We started with a table that knew one character of context, expanded it to a window of k characters, then to a vector that — in theory — carries everything. In practice it carries about ten characters before fading. Next, we stop trying to carry the past and learn to query it instead.
```

### M15 — Attention

```
ORDER: 15
TITLE: Attention
ARC: Arc 3 — Language Models
PRIOR: Linear algebra — matmul, dot product as similarity, softmax, broadcasting (m7-linear-algebra). Gradient descent, Adam, LR schedules (m10-optimization). MLP forward/backward (m11-neural-networks). Backprop on a computational graph (m12-backpropagation). Training dynamics — Xavier/He init, layer/batch norm, residual connections, dropout, weight decay (m13-training-dynamics). Everything from m14-sequence-modeling: token vocab, NLL loss, perplexity, the embedding matrix as a learned lookup, the bigram-as-one-layer-NN equivalence, the Bengio-2003 fixed-context MLP, the RNN cell h_t = tanh(W_x x_t + W_h h_{t-1} + b), backprop-through-time, vanishing/exploding gradients, and the sequential-bottleneck failure mode that motivates attention.
CONCEPTS: attention as a soft / differentiable dictionary lookup, query-key-value triple, scoring via scaled dot product, the 1/sqrt(d_k) scale and why softmax saturation makes it necessary, softmax over the time axis to produce attention weights, the weighted sum of values as the output, the three learned projections W_q / W_k / W_v and what each subspace conceptually represents, self-attention vs cross-attention, causal (autoregressive) masking via the upper-triangular −∞ trick, the full attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k) + M) V formula and its shape calculus, multi-head attention (split heads → parallel attentions → concat → output projection) and the motivation for multiple heads, why attention without positional information is permutation-equivariant and therefore broken for sequences, positional encoding (sinusoidal, learned absolute, RoPE — intuition only, no derivations), computational complexity (O(T² d) — the quadratic context cost that defines modern LLM economics), KV-cache during autoregressive inference and what it actually saves
NEXT_MODULE: m16-transformer-block (residual connections + layer norm + the feed-forward MLP + multi-head attention assembled into the canonical transformer block, then stacked N times)
ENDGAME: Attention is the operation. The rest of a transformer — residuals, layer norm, an MLP on top — is plumbing around this single core idea: every position broadcasts a query, every position offers a key, and the softmax-weighted match decides whose values you pull back. You are now one layer of glue away from the real thing.
```

### M16 — The Transformer Block

```
ORDER: 16
TITLE: The Transformer Block
ARC: Arc 3 — Language Models
PRIOR: From m11-neural-networks: MLPs as stacks of (matmul + nonlinearity), forward pass, activation functions including ReLU and GELU. From m12-backpropagation: backprop on a computational graph; gradient flow through compositions. From m13-training-dynamics: residual connections (with the gradient-highway intuition), layer norm and batch norm, variance-preserving initialization (Xavier, He), dropout, weight decay. From m14-sequence-modeling: token vocab, embedding lookup, NLL loss, perplexity, the bigram-as-one-layer-NN equivalence, the full chain "tokens → embedding → predict next token." From m15-attention: full scaled dot-product self-attention with the matrix form softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V, causal masking, three flavors of positional encoding (sinusoidal, learned absolute, RoPE), multi-head as parallel subspaces, the T² cost and the KV cache. From m7-linear-algebra: matmul, softmax, broadcasting.
CONCEPTS: the canonical transformer block as x → x + MHA(LN(x)) → x + FFN(LN(x)) — two sub-layers, each wrapped in residual + layer norm; pre-LN vs post-LN architectures and the empirical / gradient-flow argument for pre-LN winning at depth; the residual stream as a per-token vector that every block reads from and writes to (Anthropic mech-interp framing); the position-wise feed-forward block as a 2-layer MLP applied independently to every token's vector with no cross-token mixing; the 4× hidden-dimension expansion convention (d_model → 4 d_model → d_model); GELU vs ReLU as the modern FFN activation choice; stacking N transformer blocks for depth; the final layer norm at the top of the stack before the language-modeling head; the unembedding matrix as the projection from d_model back to vocabulary-size logits; weight tying — sharing parameters between the input embedding and the output unembedding; the complete top-to-bottom forward pass: token ids → embedding lookup → + positional encoding → N × transformer block → final layer norm → unembedding → softmax → next-token distribution; parameter count budget per block (≈ 4d² from attention projections + ≈ 8d² from the FFN's two matrices, roughly 12d² per block, dominated by the FFN as d grows); where dropout sits in the standard recipe.
NEXT_MODULE: m17-tokenization-sampling (byte-pair encoding tokenization, sampling strategies — temperature, top-k, top-p, beam search — and the inference loop that wraps around a trained transformer to actually generate text)
ENDGAME: This is the transformer. Tokens at the bottom, attention + MLP blocks in the middle, an unembedding at the top, the bigram-style NLL loss as the training objective. Stack N of them, train with Adam and a warmup schedule, and you have GPT.
```

### M17 — Tokenization, Training & Sampling

```
ORDER: 17
TITLE: Tokenization, Training & Sampling
ARC: Arc 4 — Capstone
PRIOR: From m7-linear-algebra: matmul, softmax, broadcasting. From m8-probability: categorical distributions, sampling from a probability simplex. From m9-information-theory: entropy, cross-entropy, perplexity = exp(NLL). From m10-optimization: Adam / AdamW, LR warmup + cosine decay, mini-batch SGD. From m11-neural-networks: MLP forward/backward, embedding lookups. From m12-backpropagation: loss.backward(), .zero_grad(), gradient checking, common backprop bugs. From m13-training-dynamics: train vs val loss, overfitting, weight decay, dropout, learning-rate schedules in practice. From m14-sequence-modeling: tokens as a vocabulary, NLL loss on the next-token distribution, the bigram-as-one-layer-NN equivalence, the introductory treatment of greedy / temperature / top-k sampling for the bigram model. From m15-attention: causal masking, scaled dot-product attention, the KV cache during autoregressive inference and what it actually saves (recompute of K and V across already-emitted tokens). From m16-transformer-block: the full top-to-bottom forward pass — token ids → embedding + positional encoding → N × (residual + LN + MHA → residual + LN + FFN) → final LN → tied unembedding → softmax over vocab → next-token distribution; the parameter budget per block; pre-LN architecture.
CONCEPTS: tokenization as the interface between raw text and the model — the model never sees characters or bytes, only token ids; character-level tokenization (the nanoGPT-tiny default we will use in the capstone) — its strengths (no OOV, tiny vocabulary, every operation is on a learned per-character embedding) and its costs (sequence length blows up, the model has to compose more steps to "spell" anything); word-level tokenization and why it fails at scale (vocab explosion, OOV at inference time, zero morphological generalization); subword tokenization as the modern compromise; byte-pair encoding (BPE) — the merge-loop algorithm, run on a corpus once to produce a fixed merge table, then deterministically applied at inference; byte-level BPE as used in GPT-2/3 (operating on the 256 raw bytes rather than Unicode codepoints, which makes the tokenizer total — every input string is representable, no UNK token); the trained tokenizer as a fixed artifact shipped alongside the model weights; how tokenization shapes what the model can and cannot do (multi-digit arithmetic, capital-letter handling, the "how many R's in strawberry" failure mode); vocabulary size as a hyperparameter and its tradeoff between sequence length T and embedding-table size; the standard training loop wrapped around the m16 forward pass — sample a batch of (B, T) sequences from the tokenized corpus, forward, compute NLL across all (B, T) positions, backward, AdamW step, zero grad; the data loader: from a single long stream of tokens, slice random (x, y) pairs where y is x shifted right by one; train/val split for a small corpus and what overfitting looks like (val loss diverging from train loss); expected loss trajectory on tiny-shakespeare-character (start near log(vocab_size) ≈ 4.2, drop fast, plateau near val NLL ≈ 1.5 — perplexity ≈ 4–5 — for a small model); the gradient-clipping and learning-rate-schedule choices that nanoGPT actually ships with; the autoregressive inference loop wrapped around the same forward pass — given a prompt, run the model, sample one token, append, repeat until a stop condition or max length; greedy / argmax sampling and why deterministic decoding produces repetitive, mode-collapsed text on a generative LM; temperature τ as logits / τ before softmax — τ → 0 collapses to greedy, τ → ∞ collapses to uniform, τ = 1 is the model's own distribution; top-k filtering — keep only the k highest-logit tokens, renormalize, sample; top-p (nucleus) sampling — keep the smallest prefix of the sorted distribution whose cumulative mass ≥ p, renormalize, sample; how temperature, top-k, and top-p compose in practice and the order they are applied; beam search and why generative language modeling does not use it (creative generation needs diversity, not maximum-likelihood paths) — contrast with translation/summarization where beam search is still common; the KV cache during sampling — callback to m15 — and why it turns the per-token inference cost from O(T²) to O(T); the random seed as the only source of variation in a frozen model with fixed sampling parameters; "controlling" a generative model entirely from the outside via prompt + sampling settings, no weight changes.
NEXT_MODULE: m18-capstone (train your own tiny transformer in the browser via WebGPU on the tiny-shakespeare corpus — 4 layers, 4 heads, d_model = 128, T = 64, ~200k parameters — and ship the resulting weights + a sampling-knob playground)
ENDGAME: Tokenization is how text becomes vectors. The training loop is how those vectors get good. Sampling is how good vectors become text again. You now have everything between a corpus of bytes and a model that talks. Next module: you actually train one in your browser.

## Widget research template (fire per interactive widget)

Some widgets in the design doc are their own pedagogical research project. Use this shorter template for those.

```
# Widget research: {{WIDGET_NAME}}

## Role
(same role block as the module template)

## The widget
I am building an interactive Svelte + Mafs widget called {{WIDGET_NAME}} for Module {{ORDER}} of Tinker. Its job is to make the following pedagogical moment tangible: {{MOMENT}}.

## Deliverables — return these 6 sections, nothing else

### 1. Prior art
5–8 existing interactive widgets on the web that do something similar. For each: URL, what it lets the user manipulate, what it does well, what it does badly, whether it's free to clone (MIT/CC BY) or reference-only.

### 2. Design variants
4–6 different ways this widget could be designed. For each:
- **Interaction surface** — what the learner drags, clicks, scrubs
- **Live updates** — what visual state changes in response
- **Failure mode** — the "boring slider" degenerate case this variant risks
- **Strength** — what this variant teaches that others don't

### 3. Pedagogical pitfalls
Specific things that go wrong when learners use widgets of this kind. Include the Bret Victor criticism ("adjust mystery numbers") and Nicky Case's "sandbox without scaffolding" failure mode where applicable.

### 4. Accessibility
Keyboard navigation plan, screen-reader labels, color-blind-safe alternatives, motion-reduction fallback.

### 5. Recommended variant
Pick ONE. Say why. Include a rough storyboard: initial state → first interaction → aha moment → final state.

### 6. Parametrization
Exact numerical defaults — viewBox ranges, slider min/max, default parameter values — that produce the intended pedagogical moment on load.

## Post-research workflow

When Deep Research returns, save to `docs/research/m{N}-{slug}.md` and start a Claude Code session with:

```
Read docs/research/m7-linear-algebra.md. Convert sections 6 (lesson decomposition) and 7 (problem bank) into MDX lessons under apps/docs/src/content/lessons/, following the existing Step / StepCheck / EndgameCallback pattern used in what-is-a-derivative.mdx and the-chain-rule.mdx. For each lesson, propose any new Svelte widgets we need and write stubs for them (I'll fill in the svelte-mafs integration). Update the m7-linear-algebra.md module file's status from `planned` to `drafting`. Deploy.
```

Expect 3–6 lessons per module and 1–3 new widgets per module. Per-module cycle: one research fire → one conversion session → one editing pass → deploy.
